We reproduce the GPT-2 (124M) from scratch. This video covers the whole process: First we build the GPT-2 network, then we optimize its training to be really fast, then we set up the training run following the GPT-2 and GPT-3 paper and their hyperparameters, then we hit run, and come back the next morning to see our results, and enjoy some amusing model generations. Keep in mind that in some places this video builds on the knowledge from earlier videos in the Zero to Hero Playlist (see my channel). You could also see this video as building my nanoGPT repo, which by the end is about 90% similar.

# build nanoGPT

This repo holds the from-scratch reproduction of nanoGPT. The git commits were specifically kept step by step and clean so that one can easily walk through the git commit history to see it built slowly. Additionally, there is an accompanying video lecture on YouTube where you can see me introduce each commit and explain the pieces along the way.

We basically start from an empty file and work our way to a reproduction of the GPT-2 (124M) model. If you have more patience or money, the code can also reproduce the GPT-3 models. While the GPT-2 (124M) model probably trained for quite some time back in the day (2019, ~5 years ago), today, reproducing it is a matter of ~1hr and ~$10. You'll need a cloud GPU box if you don't have enough, for that I recommend Lambda.

Note that GPT-2 and GPT-3 and both simple language models, trained on internet documents, and all they do is "dream" internet documents. So this repo/video this does not cover Chat finetuning, and you can't talk to it like you can talk to ChatGPT. The finetuning process (while quite simple conceptually - SFT is just about swapping out the dataset and continuing the training) comes after this part and will be covered at a later time. For now this is the kind of stuff that the 124M model says if you prompt it with "Hello, I'm a language model," after 10B tokens of training:

```
Hello, I'm a language model, and my goal is to make English as easy and fun as possible for everyone, and to find out the different grammar rules
Hello, I'm a language model, so the next time I go, I'll just say, I like this stuff.
Hello, I'm a language model, and the question is, what should I do if I want to be a teacher?
Hello, I'm a language model, and I'm an English person. In languages, "speak" is really speaking. Because for most people, there's
```

And after 40B tokens of training:

```
Hello, I'm a language model, a model of computer science, and it's a way (in mathematics) to program computer programs to do things like write
Hello, I'm a language model, not a human. This means that I believe in my language model, as I have no experience with it yet.
Hello, I'm a language model, but I'm talking about data. You've got to create an array of data: you've got to create that.
Hello, I'm a language model, and all of this is about modeling and learning Python. I'm very good in syntax, however I struggle with Python due
```

Lol. Anyway, once the video comes out, this will also be a place for FAQ, and a place for fixes and errata, of which I am sure there will be a number :)

For discussions and questions, please use Discussions tab, and for faster communication, have a look at my Zero To Hero Discord, channel #nanoGPT:

# Video

Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M) YouTube lecture

# Errata

Minor cleanup, we forgot to delete register_buffer of the bias once we switched to flash attention, fixed with a recent PR.

Earlier version of PyTorch may have difficulty converting from uint16 to long. Inside load_tokens, we added npt = npt.astype(np.int32) to use numpy to convert uint16 to int32 before converting to torch tensor and then converting to long.

The torch.autocast function takes an arg device_type, to which I tried to stubbornly just pass device hoping it works ok, but PyTorch actually really wants just the type and creates errors in some version of PyTorch. So we want e.g. the device cuda:3 to get stripped to cuda. Currently, device mps (Apple Silicon) would become device_type CPU, I'm not 100% sure this is the intended PyTorch way.

Confusingly, model.require_backward_grad_sync is actually used by both the forward and backward pass. Moved up the line so that it also gets applied to the forward pass.

## build-nanoGPT

这个仓库是对 **nanoGPT** 从零实现的复现。Git 提交历史被精心保留为一步步、干净整洁的记录，方便大家逐步查看整个构建过程。此外，我还在 YouTube 上录制了一段视频讲解，你可以看到我依次介绍每个提交，并解释其中的每个部分。

我们基本上是从一个空文件开始，最终复现了 GPT-2（124M）模型。如果你有更多耐心或预算，也可以用这些代码复现 GPT-3 模型。虽然当年（2019 年，也就是大约 5 年前）训练 GPT-2（124M）可能需要很长时间，但如今复现它只需要大约 1 小时和约 10 美元的成本。如果你本地没有足够的 GPU，建议使用云端 GPU，比如 [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com)。

注意：GPT-2 和 GPT-3 都是简单的语言模型，它们的训练数据来自互联网文档，而它们的作用只是“梦想”互联网文档（即模拟互联网内容的生成）。因此，这个仓库/视频并不涉及 Chat 微调，所以你无法像使用 ChatGPT 一样“与它对话”。微调流程（虽然概念上很简单——比如监督式微调 SFT 就是更换数据集并继续训练）属于后续内容，将在以后讲解。

目前，以下是我们用“Hello, I'm a language model”作为提示词，在训练了 **100 亿个 token** 后，模型的输出示例：

> Hello, I'm a language model, and my goal is to make English as easy and fun as possible for everyone, and to find out the different grammar rules
> Hello, I'm a language model, so the next time I go, I'll just say, I like this stuff.
> Hello, I'm a language model, and the question is, what should I do if I want to be a teacher?
> Hello, I'm a language model, and I'm an English person. In languages, "speak" is really speaking. Because for most people, there's

而在训练了 **400 亿个 token** 后的输出是：

> Hello, I'm a language model, a model of computer science, and it's a way (in mathematics) to program computer programs to do things like write
> Hello, I'm a language model, not a human. This means that I believe in my language model, as I have no experience with it yet.
> Hello, I'm a language model, but I'm talking about data. You've got to create an array of data: you've got to create that.
> Hello, I'm a language model, and all of this is about modeling and learning Python. I'm very good in syntax, however I struggle with Python due

哈哈，总之，视频发布后，这里也会成为 FAQ 的整理地，以及发布修复和勘误（应该会有不少 :)）。

如有问题或讨论，请使用 GitHub 的 Discussions 页面。若想更快交流，也可以加入我在 Zero To Hero 系列中的 Discord，频道是 **#nanoGPT**。

### ⚠️ 勘误（Errata）

* 有个小问题是我们在启用 flash attention 后，忘记删除 `bias` 的 `register_buffer`，已通过近期的 PR 修复。
* 较旧版本的 PyTorch 在将 `uint16` 转为 `long` 时可能有问题，我们在 `load_tokens` 函数中增加了一行：
  `npt = npt.astype(np.int32)`
  先用 NumPy 转为 int32，再转为 torch tensor，最后转为 long。
* `torch.autocast` 函数需要一个 `device_type` 参数，我最初直接传了 `device`，结果在某些 PyTorch 版本中报错。正确方式是将 `cuda:3` 这样的设备简化为 `cuda`。
* Apple Silicon 上的 `mps` 设备会被识别为 CPU 的 `device_type`，我不太确定 PyTorch 是否就是这么设计的。
* `model.require_backward_grad_sync` 实际上在正向和反向传播中都会用到，因此我们将这行代码上移，以确保在正向传播中也生效。

# intro: Let’s reproduce GPT-2 (124M)

hi everyone so today we are going to be continuing our Zero to Hero series and in particular today we are going to
reproduce the gpt2 model the 124 million version of it so when openi released
gpt2 this was 2019 and they released it with this blog post on top of that they
released this paper and on top of that they released this code on GitHub so open a/
gpt2 now when we talk about reproducing gpt2 we have to be careful because in particular in this video we're going to
be reproducing the 124 million parameter model so the thing to realize is that there's always a miniseries when these
are releases are made so there are the gpt2 miniseries made up of models at
different sizes and usually the biggest model is called the gpt2 but basically the reason we do that
is because you can put the model sizes on the x-axis of plots like this and on the Y AIS you put a lot of uh Downstream
metrics that you're interested in like translation summarization question answering and so on and you can chart out these scaling laws so basically as
the model size increases you're getting better and better at Downstream metrics and so in particular for
gpt2 if we scroll down in paper there are four models in the gpt2 miniseries
starting at 124 million all the way up to 1558 million now the reason my
numbers the way I say them disagree with this table is that this table is wrong if you actually go to the uh gpt2 uh
GitHub repo they sort of say that um there was an error in how they added up the parameters but basically this is the
124 million parameter model Etc so the 124 million parameter had 12 layers in
the Transformer and it had 768 channels in the Transformer 768 dimensions and
I'm going to be assuming some familiarity with what these terms mean because I covered all of this in my previous video let's build gpt2 uh let's
build GPT from scratch so I covered that in the previous video in this playlist now if we do everything correctly and
everything works out well by the end of this video we're going to see something like this where we're looking at the
validation loss which basically um measures how good we are at predicting
the next token in a sequence on some validation data that the model has not seen during training and we see that we
go from doing that task not very well because we're initializing from scratch all the way to doing that task quite
well um by the end of the training and hopefully we're going to beat the gpt2 uh 124 M model
now previously when they were working on this this is already 5 years ago so this was probably a fairly complicated
optimization at the time and the gpus and the compute was a lot smaller today you can reproduce this model in roughly
an hour or probably less even and it will cost you about 10 bucks if you want to do this on the cloud uh Cloud Compu a
sort of computer that you can all rent and if you pay $10 for that computer you wait about an hour or less you can
actually achieve a model that is as good as this model that open ey released and
uh one more thing to mention is unlike many other models open ey did release the weights for gpt2 so those weights
are all available in this repository but the gpt2 paper is not always as good
with all of the details of training so in addition to the gpt2 paper we're going to be referencing the gpt3 paper
which is a lot more Concrete in a lot of the hyp parameters and optimization settings and so on um and it's not a
huge departure in the architecture from the GPT 2 uh version of the model so we're going to be referencing both gpt2
and gpt3 as we try to reproduce gpt2 124 M uh so let's go so the first thing I

当然可以，以下是你这段视频内容的中文解释：

# 导语：我们来复现 GPT-2（124M）

大家好，今天我们将继续《Zero to Hero（从零到高手）》系列课程，这一节的主题是：**复现 GPT-2 模型（124M 参数版本）**。

### 什么是 GPT-2 124M？

在 2019 年，OpenAI 发布了 GPT-2。他们同时发布了：

* 一篇博客文章介绍模型；
* 一篇论文讲解架构；
* 以及模型代码（开源在 GitHub 上，地址是 `openai/gpt-2`）。

GPT-2 实际上并不只指一个模型，而是一整个“迷你系列”（miniseries）——它包含了多个规模的模型。最大的一个通常才被简称为“GPT-2”，但实际上是多种不同规模的版本组合。

### 为什么要复现 GPT-2？

复现 GPT-2 是因为它是 Transformer 架构中非常经典、影响深远的模型之一。而且这些模型都遵循某种“**扩展规律**”（Scaling Laws）——你可以把模型的参数量放在 X 轴，然后在 Y 轴上放各种下游任务的性能指标，比如翻译、摘要、问答等等。你会发现：**模型越大，效果越好**。

所以，在 GPT-2 系列中，有四个模型，从 124M 参数起步，一直到 1558M 参数（约 15 亿）。不过，视频中也提到一个小问题：GPT-2 论文中的参数表是错的，OpenAI 后来在 GitHub 上更正了这些数值。我们这次复现的是最小的那个：**124M 参数的 GPT-2 模型**。

这个 124M 模型的架构包括：

* 12 层 Transformer 层；
* 每层的维度是 768；
  这些技术细节在前一节视频（从零实现 GPT）中已经讲解过了，这里默认大家已经有一定的基础。

### 目标是什么？

我们希望从 **完全空白** 开始实现 GPT-2 模型，然后训练它，最后在验证集上达到一个不错的效果。验证损失（validation loss）是我们评估模型的标准，代表它预测下一个 token 的能力。训练开始时，模型几乎什么都不会，但训练到最后，应该能比肩甚至超过 OpenAI 提供的原始 GPT-2 124M 模型的效果。

### 所需资源和花费

虽然 OpenAI 当年训练这个模型可能花了不少时间和计算资源（那是 5 年前的事了），但 **现在只需约 1 小时和大约 10 美元**（使用云端 GPU）就可以训练出一个同等水平的模型了。如果你没有本地 GPU，可以用像 Lambda 这样的云服务租用计算资源。

### 关于权重和参考资料

OpenAI 发布了 GPT-2 的模型权重（weights），所以我们可以直接加载并参考这些权重。但问题是，GPT-2 的论文里没有详细写出所有的训练细节。因此我们还会参考 **GPT-3 的论文**，因为它在超参数设置和优化方法上描述得更具体。而且 GPT-3 的架构与 GPT-2 并没有本质区别。

---

总之，这节视频的目标是：**从零开始实现 GPT-2（124M）模型，并成功训练它**，期间还会参考 GPT-2 和 GPT-3 的训练经验。

如果你需要，我可以继续解释视频中的其他章节，比如模型构建、训练过程、性能优化等等。


# exploring the GPT-2 (124M) OpenAI checkpoint

would like to do is actually start at the end or at the Target so in other words let's load the GPT to 124 M model
as it was released by openi and maybe take it for a spin let's sample some tokens from it now the issue with that
is when you go into the code base of gpt2 and you go into the source and you click in on the model. pi you'll realize
that actually this is using tensorflow so the original gpt2 code here was written in tensor flow which is
um you know not let's just say not used as much anymore um so we'd like to use
pytorch uh because it's a lot friendlier easier and I just personally like a lot more the problem with that is the
initial code is intenser flow we'd like to use pytorch so instead uh to get the target we're going to use the hugging
face Transformers um code which I like a lot more so when you go into the
Transformers source Transformers models gpt2 modeling gpt2 Pi you will see that
they have the gpt2 implementation of that Transformer here in this file um and it's like medium readable
but not fully readable um but what it does is it did all the work of converting all those weights uh from
tensor flow to pytorch Friendly and so it's much easier to load and work with so in particular we can look at the
gpt2 um model here and we can load it using hugging face Transformers so swinging over this is what that looks
like from Transformers import the DP GT2 LM head model and then from pre-train
gpt2 uh now one awkward thing about this is that when you do gpt2 as the model that we're loading this actually is the
124 million parameter model if you want the actual the gpt2 the 1.5 billion then
you actually want to do- XL so this is the 12 4 M our Target now what we're
doing is when we actually get this we're initializing the uh pytorch NN module as defined here in this
class from it I want to get just the state dict which is just a raw tensors
so we just have um the tensors of that file and by the way here this is a jupyter notebook uh but this is jupyter
notebook running inside vs code uh so I like to work with it all in a single sort of interface so I like to use vs
code so this is the jupyter notebook extension inside the es
code so when we get the state dick this is just a dict so we can print the key
and the value which is the tensor and let's just look at the shapes so these are sort of
the uh different parameters inside the gbt2 model and their shape so the W
weight for token embedding is of size
50257 by 768 where this is coming from is that we have 50257 tokens in the gpt2 vocabulary um
and the tokens by the way these are exactly the tokens that we spoken about in the previous video on my tokenization
Series so the previous videos just before this I go into a ton of detail on tokenization gpt2 tokenizer happens to
have this many tokens for each token we have a 768 dimensional
embedding that is the distributed representation that stands in for that token so each token is a little string
piece and then the 768 numbers are the vector that represents that
token and so this is just our lookup table for tokens and then here we have the lookup table for the positions so
because gbt2 has a maximum sequence length of 1024 we have up to 1,24 positions that
each token can be attending to in the past and every one of those positions in gpd2 has a fixed Vector of
768 that is learned by optimization um and so this is the
position embedding and the token embedding um and then everything here is just the other weights and biases and
everything else of this Transformer so when you just take for example the positional embeddings and
flatten it out and take just the 20 elements you can see that these are just the parameters these are weights floats
just we can take and we can plot them so these are the position embeddings and we
get something like this and you can see that this has structure and it has structure because what we what we have
here really is every Row in this visualization is a different position a
fixed absolute position in um the range from 0 to 1024 and each row here is the
representation of that position and so it has structure because these positional embeddings end up learning
these sinusoids and cosiness um that sort of like represent each of these
positions and uh each row here stands in for that position and is processed by the Transformer to recover all the
relative positions and uh sort of realize which token is where and um
attend to them depending on their position not just their content so when we actually just look
into an individual column inside these and I just grabbed three random columns
you'll see that for example here we are focusing on every every single um
Channel and we're looking at what that channel is doing as a
function of uh position from one from Z to 1223
really and we can see that some of these channels basically like respond more or less to different parts of the position
Spectrum so this green channel uh really likes to fire for everything after 200
uh up to 800 but not less a lot less and has a sharp drop off here near zero so
who knows what these embeddings are doing and why they are the way they are you can tell for example that because they're a bit more Jagged and they're
kind of noisy you can tell that this model was not fully trained and the more trained this model was the more you
would expect to smooth this out and so this is telling you that this is a little bit of an undertrained model um
but in principle actually these curves don't even have to be smooth this should just be totally random noise and in fact
in the beginning of the optimization it is complete random noise because this position embedding table is initialized
completely at random so in the beginning you have jaggedness and the fact that you end up with something smooth is
already kind of impressive um that that just falls out of the optimization because in principle you shouldn't even
be able to get any single graph out of this that makes sense but we actually get something that looks a little bit
noisy but for the most part looks sinusoidal like um in the original Transformer um in the original
Transformer paper the attention is all you need paper the positional embeddings are actually initialized and fixed if I
remember correctly to sinusoids and cosiness of uh different frequencies and that's the positional coding and it's
fixed but in gpt2 these are just parameters and they're trained from scratch just like any other parameter uh
and that seems to work about as well and so what they do is they kind of like recover these sinusoidal like features
during the optimization we can also look at any of the other matrices here so here I took
the first layer of the Transformer and looking at like one of
its weights and just the first block of 300 by 300 and you see some structure
but like again like who knows what any of this is if you're into mechanistic interpretability you might get a real
kick out of trying to figure out like what is going on what is this structure and what does this all mean but we're
not going to be doing that in this video but we definitely see that there's some interesting structure and that's kind of cool what we're mostly interested in is
we've loaded the weights of this model that was released by open Ai and now using the hogging face Transformers we
can not just get all the raw weights but we can also get the um what they call
Pipeline and sample from it so this is the prefix hello I'm a language model
comma and then we're sampling uh 30 tokens and we getting five sequences and
I ran this and this is what it produced um hell language model but what I'm really doing is
making a human readable document there are other languages but those are dot dot dot so you can read through these if
you like but basically these are five different completions of the same prefix from this uh gbt
2124m now uh if I go here I took this example from here and sadly even though
we are fixing the seed we are getting different Generations from the snippet than what they got so presumably the
code changed um but what we see though at this stage that's important is that
we are getting coherent text so we've loaded the model successfully we can look at all its parameters and the keys
tell us where in the model these come from and we want to actually write our
own gpt2 class so that we have full understanding of what's happening there we don't want to be working with something like uh the modeling gpt2 Pi
because it's just too complicated we want to write this from scratch ourselves so we're going to be implementing the GPT model here in
parallel and as our first task let's load the gpt2 124 M into the class that
we're going to develop here from scratch that's going to give us confidence that we can load the open ey model and
therefore there's a setting of Weights that exactly is the 124 model but then of course what we're going to do is
we're going to initialize the model from scratch instead and try try to train it ourselves um on a bunch of documents
that we're going to get and we're going to try to surpass that model so we're going to get different weights and everything's going to look different
hopefully better even um but uh we're going to have a lot of confidence that because we can load the
openi model we are in the same model family and model class and we just have to ReDiscover a good setting of the
weights uh but from scratch so let's now write the gbt2 model and let's load the
weights and make sure that we can also generate text that looks coherent okay so let's now swing over to the attention

当然可以，以下是这段视频内容的中文解释：

## 探索 OpenAI 的 GPT-2（124M）模型检查点（Checkpoint）

我们这次的做法有点“反向”，**从终点开始**，也就是说，我们先来加载 OpenAI 发布的 GPT-2 124M 模型，然后尝试用它来生成一些文本，看看效果。

### OpenAI 的原始 GPT-2 代码用的是 TensorFlow

当你去查看 OpenAI 提供的 GPT-2 仓库时，会发现他们最初是用 **TensorFlow** 写的（比如 `model.py` 文件）。
但现在 TensorFlow 已经不太常用了，**PyTorch 更受欢迎、易用性更好**，我个人也更喜欢 PyTorch。

### 转而使用 Hugging Face Transformers 实现

为了解决 TensorFlow 不方便的问题，我们选择使用 Hugging Face 的 Transformers 库，它里面已经帮我们把 GPT-2 的 TensorFlow 权重**转换成了 PyTorch 可用格式**。

具体地，我们查看 Transformers 源码中的：

```
transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py
```

这个文件中实现了 GPT-2 的 PyTorch 版本（虽然代码有点复杂，但可读性还行）。

我们可以像这样使用它：

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```

> 这里的 `"gpt2"` 就是 124M 参数版本（注意不是最大那个 1.5B 模型，要加载 1.5B 的话用 `"gpt2-xl"`）。

加载之后，这个模型是 PyTorch 的 `nn.Module` 类型，我们可以提取它的 **`state_dict`（状态字典）**，也就是模型所有的参数张量（tensor）。
在 Jupyter Notebook（我是在 VSCode 里运行的）中，我们可以把这些张量的键（参数名）和值（形状）打印出来看看。

### 模型的参数组成

举个例子：

```python
wte.weight.shape  # 输出: [50257, 768]
```

* `50257` 是 GPT-2 的词表大小；
* `768` 是每个 token 的嵌入维度（embedding size）；
* 所以这张量就是词嵌入矩阵（token embedding table）。

同理，还有位置嵌入（positional embedding），因为 GPT-2 最长序列长度是 1024，所以它还有一个大小为 `[1024, 768]` 的位置嵌入矩阵。

这两个嵌入是模型输入阶段非常关键的部分。

### 可视化位置嵌入

我们可以把位置嵌入的前 20 个向量画成图，可以看到它们**具有一定的结构**，而不是完全的随机噪声。

每一行代表一个位置（从 0 到 1023），每行的 768 个数代表这个位置的向量表示。
这些向量被模型用来判断每个 token 的相对位置。

进一步地，我们还可以选出其中的几列（几个维度）来看它们在不同位置上的响应情况。你会发现它们在某些位置范围内“激活”更多——说明它们**学习到了一定的位置感知能力**。

> 这很像最初 Transformer 论文中用的 `sin`/`cos` 位置编码，但 GPT-2 是**学习出来的**而不是固定函数。

而且可以看出这些向量比较“抖动”或“不光滑”，说明这个模型没有完全训练好（可能只是一个快速发布的模型）。训练越充分，这些向量的结构就越平滑。

### 查看其他权重矩阵

我们还可以查看比如 Transformer 第一层中某个线性变换权重矩阵的一部分，比如 `300x300` 的片段，发现里面也有些规律性结构，但很难一眼看懂。这属于 “可解释性” 的研究范畴（mechanistic interpretability）。

不过本视频不打算深挖这些，我们只是验证：

1. 成功加载了 OpenAI 发布的 GPT-2（124M）模型；
2. 能访问所有参数，并理解它们的结构和含义；
3. **可以从中采样生成文本**。

### 使用模型生成文本示例

我们给模型一个前缀，例如：

```text
"Hello, I'm a language model,"
```

然后采样生成 30 个 token，重复 5 次，得到不同的输出：

例如：

> "Hello, I'm a language model, but what I'm really doing is making a human readable document..."
> "Hello, I'm a language model, and there are other languages but those are..."
> （这些都是真实输出）

即使我们设置了随机种子（`seed`），生成的文本可能还是跟官方代码略有不同（可能是代码有更新）。但关键是：**文本是连贯的**，说明模型加载和推理是成功的。

---

## 目标小结

我们希望在后续做两件事：

1. **自己手动从零写一个 GPT-2 类**（不依赖 Hugging Face 的封装）；
2. 然后尝试加载 OpenAI 发布的 124M 权重进我们自己的模型类；
3. 最终，在我们自己的模型上进行从零训练，看是否能训练出**比 OpenAI 官方模型更好的结果**。

这样我们就不仅理解了模型结构，还能从头掌握训练流程和参数细节。

如果你想，我可以帮你进一步梳理参数结构或写一个简化版本的 `GPT2` 类。是否需要？


# SECTION 1: implementing the GPT-2 nn.Module

is all un need paper that started everything and let's scroll over to the model architecture the original
Transformer now remember that gpt2 is slightly modified from the or or Transformer in particular we do not have
uh the encoder gpt2 is a decoder only Transformer as we call it so this entire encoder here is missing in addition to
that this cross attention here that was using that encoder is also missing so we delete this entire part everything else
stays almost the same but there are some differences that we're going to uh sort of look at here so there are two main
differences when we go to the gb2 page under 2.3 model we notice that first
there's a reshuffling of the layer Norms so they change place and second an
additional layer normalization was added here to the final self detention block
so basically all the layer Norms here instead of being after the MLP or after the attention they SN before it and an
additional layer Norm gets added here right before the final classifier so now let's Implement some
of the first sort of skeleton NN module modules here in our GPT NN module and in
particular we're going to try to match up this schema here that is used by hugging face Transformers because that
will make it much easier to load these weights from this state dict so we want something that reflects uh this schema
here so here's what I came up with um basically we see that the main
container here that has all the modules is called Transformer so I'm reflecting that with an NN module dict and this is
basically a module that allows you to index into the subm modules using keys just like a dictionary uh
strings within it we have the weights of the token embeddings WT and that's an N
embedding and the weights of the position embeddings which is also just an N embedding and if you remember n
embedding is really just a fancy little wrapper module around just a single um
single array of numbers a single uh block of numbers just like this it's a
single tensor and an embedding is a glorified um wrapper around a tensor
that allows you to access its elements uh by indexing into the rows now in addition to that we see here
that we have a h and then there's a this is index using numbers instead of
indexed using strings so there's a h. 0 1 2 Etc all the way up till h. 11 and
that's because there are 12 layers here in this Transformer so to reflect that I'm creating also an H I think that
probably stands for hidden and instead of a module dict this is a model list so we can index it using integers exactly
as we see here 01 2 Etc and the modular list has a n layer blocks and the blocks
are yet to be defined in a module in a bit in addition to that following the gpt2 paper we have we need an additional
final layer Norm that we're going to put in there and then we have the final classifier uh the language model head
which um projects from 768 the number of embedding dimensions in this GPT all the
way to the vocab size which is 50257 and gpt2 uses no bias for this
final uh sort of projection so this is the skeleton and you can see that it
reflects this so the wte is the token embeddings here it's called output
embedding but it's really the token embeddings the PE is the positional codings uh those two pieces of
information as we saw previously are going to add and then go into the Transformer the H is the all the blocks
in Gray and the LNF is this new layer that gets added here by the gpt2 model
and LM head is this linear part here so that's the skeleton of the gpt2 we now
have to implement the block okay so let's now recurse to the block itself so
we want to define the block um so I'll start putting them here so the block I
like to write out like this uh these are some of the initializations and then this is the
actual forward pass of what this block computes and notice here that there's a change from the Transformer again that
is mentioned in the gpt2 paper so here the layer normalizations are after the
application of attention or feed forward in addition to that note that the normalizations are inside the residual
stream you see how feed forward is applied and this arrow goes through and through the normalization so that means
that your residual pathway has normalizations inside them and this is not very good or desirable uh you
actually prefer to have a single uh clean residual stream all the way from supervision all the way down to the
inputs the tokens and this is very desirable and nice because the gradients
that flow from the top if you remember from your microad addition just distributes gradients during the
backwards state to both of its branches equally so addition is a branch in the
gradients and so that means that the gradients from the top flows straight to the inputs the tokens through the
residual Pathways unchanged but then in addition to that the gradient also flows through the blocks and the blocks you
know contribute their own contribution over time and kick in and change the optimization over time but basically
clean residual pathway is desirable from an optimization perspective and then the
this is the pre-normalization version where you see that RX first goes through the layer normalization and then the
attention and then goes uh back out to go to the L ration number two and the
multia perceptron sometimes also referred to as a feed forward Network or an FFN and then that goes into the
residual stream again and the one more thing that is kind of interesting to note is that recall that attention is a
communication operation it is where all the tokens and there's 1,24 tokens lined up in a sequence and this is where the
tokens communicate this is where they exchange information so attention is a
um aggregation function it's a pooling function it's a weighted sum function it
is a reduce operation whereas MLP this uh MLP here happens at every single
token individually there's no information being collected or exchanged between the tokens so the attention is
the reduce and the MLP is the map and what you end up with is that the Transformer just ends up just being a
repeated application of map produce if you want to think about it that way so
um this is where they communicate and this is where they think individually about the information that they gathered
and every one of these blocks uh iteratively refines the um representation is at the residual stream
so this is our block um slightly modified from this picture Okay so let's now move on to the MLP so the MLP block
uh I implemented as follows it is relatively straightforward we basically have two linear projections
here that are sandwiched in between the G nonlinearity so nn. G approximate is 10h
now when we swing on uh swing over to the Pyro documentation this is n.g and
it has this format and it has two versions the original version of G which we'll step into into in a bit and the
approximate version of Galo which we can request using 10 so as you can see just as a preview
here G is a basically like a reu except there's no flat exactly Flat Tail here
at exactly zero but otherwise it looks very much like a slightly smoother reu
it comes from this paper here Gan error linear units and uh you can step through
this paper and there's some mathematical calac reasoning that leads to an interpretation that leads to the specific formulation it has to do with
stochastic radial risers and the expectation of a modification to Adaptive dropout so you can read through
all of that if you'd like here and there's a little bit of history as to why there is an an approximate version
of G and that comes from this issue here as far as I can tell and in this issue
Daniel Hendrix mentions that at the time when they developed this nonlinearity
the Earth function which you need to evaluate the exact G was very slow in tensor flow so they ended up basically
developing this approximation and this approximation that then ended up being picked up by Bert and by GP P2 Etc but
today there's no real good reason to use the approximate version you'd prefer to just use the exact version um because I
my expectation is that there's no big difference anymore and this is kind of like a historical um kind of Quirk um
but we are trying to reproduce gpt2 exactly and gpt2 used the 10h
approximate version so we prefer to stick with that um now one other reason to actually
just intuitively use G instead of veru is previously in the in videos in the past we've spoken about the dead reu
neuron problem where in this tale of a reu if it's exactly flat at zero any
activations that fall there will get exactly zero gradient there's no change there's no adaptation there's no
development of the network if any of these activations end in this flat region but the G always contributes a
local gradient and so there's always going to be a change always going to be an adaptation and sort of smoothing it
out ends up empirically working better in practice as demonstrated in this paper and also as demonstrated by it
being picked up by the bird paper gbt2 paper and so on so for that reason we adopt this nonlinearity uh here in the
10 in the gbt2 reproduction now in more modern networks also like llama 3 and so on this nonlinearity also further
changes uh to swiglo and other variants like that uh but for gpt2 they Ed this
approximate G okay and finally we have the attention operation so let me paste in my
attention so I know this is a lot so I'm going to go through this a bit quickly a bit
slowly but not too slowly because we have covered this in the previous video and I would just point you there um so
this is the attention operation now in the previous video you will remember this is not just attention this is um
multi-headed attention right and so in the previous video we had this multi-headed attention module and this
implementation made it obvious that these heads are not actually that complicated uh there's basically
in parallel inside every attention block there's multiple heads and they're all functioning in parallel and uh their
outputs are just being concatenated and that becomes the output of the multi-headed attention so the heads are
just kind of like parallel streams and their outputs get concatenated and so it was very simple
and made the head be kind of like U fairly straightforward in terms of its
implementation what happens here is that instead of having two separate modules and indeed many more modules that get
concatenated all of that is just put into a single uh self attention uh
module and instead I'm being very careful and doing a bunch of transpose
split um tensor gymnastics to make this very efficient in pych but fundamentally
and algorithmically nothing is different from the implementation we saw before um in this uh give
repository so to remind you very briefly and I don't want to go in this uh into
this in too many in too much time but we have these tokens lined up in a sequence and there's 1,20 of them and then each
token at this stage of the attention emits three vectors the query key and the value and first what happens here um
is that the queries and the keys have to multiply each other to get sort of the attention um amount like how interesting
they find each other so they have to interact multiplicatively so what we're doing here is we're calculating the qkv
we splitting it and then there's a bunch of gymnastics as I mentioned here and the way this works is that we're
basically making the number of heads and H into a batch Dimension and so it's a
batch Dimension just like B so that in these operations that follow pytorch treats B and NH as batches and it
applies all the operations on all of them in parallel in both the batch and the
heads and the operations that get applied are number one the queries and the keys intera to give us her attention
this is the autoaggressive mask that makes sure that the tokens only attend to tokens before them and never to
tokens in the future the softmax here normalizes the attention so it sums to one always and
then recall from the previous video that doing the attention Matrix multiply with the values is basically a way to do a
weighted sum of the values of the tokens that we found interesting at every single token and then the final
transpose conf VI and view is just reassembling all of that again and this actually performs the concatenation
operation so you can step through this uh slowly if you'd like um but it is equivalent mathematically to our
previous implementation is just more efficient in P torch so that's why I chose this implementation
instead now in addition to that I'm being careful with how I name my variables so for example cattin is the
same as seaten and so actually our keys should basically exactly follow the schema of the hugging face train
Transformers code and that will make it very easy for us to now Port over all the weights from exactly this sort of
naming conventions because all of our variables are named the same thing but um at this point we have finished the
gpt2 implementation and what that allows us to do is we don't have to basically use uh this file from hugging face which
is fairly long um this is uh 2,000 lines of code um instead we
just have a less than 100 lines of code and this is the complete uh gpd2 implementation so at this stage we
should just be able to take over all the weights set them and then do generation so let's see what that looks like okay

当然可以，以下是这一段内容的中文解释：

## 第 1 部分：实现 GPT-2 的 `nn.Module`（模型结构）

我们从 Transformer 最早的论文《Attention is All You Need》开始讲起。GPT-2 是对原始 Transformer 的轻微修改版本：

### GPT-2 是 **Decoder-only** 的 Transformer

与原始 Transformer 不同：

* **GPT-2 删除了 Encoder 部分**；
* 同时也删除了 Cross-Attention（因为没有 Encoder，Cross-Attention 也不需要）；
* 剩下的结构基本保留，但有几个关键的不同点：

---

### GPT-2 的结构改动（与原始 Transformer 相比）

根据 GPT-2 论文第 2.3 节：

1. **LayerNorm 的位置做了调整**，放在 Attention 和 MLP（前馈网络）**之前**；
2. **增加了一个额外的 LayerNorm**，放在 Transformer 的输出和分类器（Language Model Head）之间。

这种结构也称为 **Pre-LayerNorm 架构**，相比传统的 Post-LayerNorm，更稳定、便于训练，梯度传播也更流畅。

---

### 实现 GPT-2 的模型骨架（Skeleton）

我们要从零实现这个模型，所以首先搭建模型的大框架，并模仿 Hugging Face 的命名和结构，以便后续能直接加载官方的权重。

主要组件包括：

* `wte`: token embedding（词嵌入）
* `wpe`: position embedding（位置嵌入）
* `h`: 模型的 Transformer 层列表，共 12 层，每层是一个 `Block`（自定义类）
* `ln_f`: 最后的 LayerNorm（GPT-2 特有）
* `lm_head`: 最后的线性层（从 768 映射到词表大小 50257）

其中：

* `wte` 和 `wpe` 是 PyTorch 的 `nn.Embedding`，分别是词嵌入和位置嵌入；
* `h` 是一个 `nn.ModuleList`，包含 12 个 Block；
* `lm_head` 是一个 `nn.Linear(768, 50257, bias=False)`，用于生成词的概率分布；
* 所有这些模块统一封装在一个 `Transformer` 容器中。

---

### 实现 Transformer Block（每一层的核心结构）

每个 Block 由以下部分组成：

1. LayerNorm
2. 多头自注意力（Multi-head Self Attention）
3. LayerNorm
4. 前馈网络（MLP）

结构为：

```text
Input
 → LayerNorm → Attention → 加残差 → 
 → LayerNorm → MLP → 加残差 → 输出
```

注意：

* 残差连接直接绕过每个子模块（Attention / MLP），保证梯度流动通畅；
* 采用了 Pre-LN 架构，有助于训练稳定性；
* Attention 用于在所有 token 之间通信（是一种聚合操作）；
* MLP 则是对每个 token 独立处理（是一种逐元素映射）；
* 因此 Transformer 可以理解为“Map（MLP） + Reduce（Attention）”的反复堆叠。

---

### MLP 部分细节：GELU 激活函数

GPT-2 使用的是 **GELU（Gaussian Error Linear Unit）**，更准确地说，是它的 **近似版本 `gelu_approx`（也叫 `gelu_tanh`）**。

为什么使用近似版本？

* 原因是早期 TensorFlow 中精确版本 `gelu` 的 `erf` 函数很慢；
* 所以当时用了一个快速近似版；
* GPT-2 沿用了这个近似版本，为了忠实复现，我们也应使用它；
* GELU 比 ReLU 更平滑，没有“死亡神经元”问题，因此在 BERT、GPT 中广泛使用。

---

### Attention 部分细节：多头自注意力机制

GPT-2 使用标准的 **Multi-head Self Attention**，其工作过程为：

1. 每个 token 产生三个向量：Query、Key、Value；
2. Query 和 Key 进行点积，计算注意力分数；
3. 应用 Mask（自回归结构，只能看前面的 token）；
4. 对注意力分数进行 Softmax，得到权重；
5. 用这些权重对 Value 做加权求和，得到注意力输出；
6. 所有头的输出拼接起来，并过一个线性层。

这部分虽然实现起来比较复杂（涉及很多转置、reshape 操作），但算法本质并没有变化，只是用 PyTorch 的向量化方式实现更高效的版本。

---

### 命名一致性与参数兼容性

作者特别注意了命名方式，比如：

* `c_attn`, `c_proj` 等变量名都与 Hugging Face 保持一致；
* 这样我们就可以直接加载它们的预训练参数，无需修改变量名。

---

### 最终效果

整个 GPT-2 模型在不到 100 行代码中就实现了（相比 Hugging Face 的 2000 多行），结构清晰，逻辑一致。我们现在可以：

* 加载 Hugging Face 的预训练权重；
* 生成连贯的文本；
* 之后我们还可以用这个结构训练自己的 GPT 模型。

---

如果你需要，我可以为你整理这个 GPT-2 模型的简化版代码结构，并逐层讲解每一部分。是否需要我这么做？


介绍一下 GELU

好的 👍 我来详细介绍一下 **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit，高斯误差线性单元)**。

---

## 1. 定义

GELU 是一种 **激活函数**，常用于 Transformer（比如 GPT、BERT）里面的 MLP 层。
它的数学定义是：

$$
\text{GELU}(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x)
$$

其中 $\Phi(x)$ 是标准正态分布的累计分布函数 (CDF)。

展开形式为：

$$
\text{GELU}(x) = \frac{1}{2}x \left(1 + \text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right)
$$

* $\text{erf}$ 是误差函数（error function）。
* 直观理解：GELU 把输入 $x$ 按概率「通过」或「抑制」，而不是像 ReLU 那样硬性截断。

---

## 2. 近似公式

在深度学习库里，常用一个近似公式（计算更快）：

$$
\text{GELU}(x) \approx 0.5x \left(1 + \tanh\Big(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \big(x + 0.044715x^3\big)\Big)\right)
$$

这个公式能很好逼近原始定义，并且便于 GPU 计算。

---

## 3. 直观理解

* **ReLU**：小于 0 的输入直接变成 0，大于 0 的保留原值。
* **Sigmoid**：把输入压缩到 $[0,1]$，但是会有饱和问题。
* **GELU**：结合了 sigmoid 的平滑性和 ReLU 的稀疏性。

  * 对于负值，输出接近 0（但不是完全为 0）。
  * 对于大正值，输出接近 $x$。
  * 在 0 附近有个平滑的过渡。

所以它的效果介于 **ReLU 和 Sigmoid** 之间，更自然地对小输入进行「部分抑制」。

---

## 4. 特点和优点

1. **平滑**：不像 ReLU 那样有不连续点（在 0 处）。
2. **概率性解释**：$\Phi(x)$ 是输入服从高斯分布时大于 0 的概率，所以 GELU 可以看作「带概率的门控」。
3. **更适合 NLP**：BERT、GPT 等模型默认都用 GELU，而不是 ReLU/LeakyReLU。实践中发现训练更稳定，效果更好。

---

## 5. PyTorch 实现

在 PyTorch 里直接用：

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

x = torch.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
y = F.gelu(x)  # 调用内置 GELU
```

---

### 总结一句

**GELU = x × Φ(x)**，它是一种平滑版的 ReLU，兼顾了稀疏性和连续性，在 Transformer 系列模型中非常常见。

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **对比图 (ReLU vs Sigmoid vs GELU)**，让你直观看出它们的差别？

https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html

# 为什么在Self-Attention前面加上Causal

好问题 👌
我们说的 **Causal Self-Attention**，其实就是在普通的 Self-Attention 基础上，加了一个 **因果约束 (causality constraint)**。

---

## 1. 普通 Self-Attention

在标准 Transformer（比如机器翻译的 Encoder）里，**每个 token 可以和序列中所有 token 交互**。

* 第 5 个词可以“看到”第 1\~10 个词；
* 第 3 个词也能看到第 4、5、6 … 后面的词。

这样没问题，因为在翻译任务里，整句话是已知的。

---

## 2. 为什么要加 Causal？

在 **语言模型 (LM, GPT)** 里，我们是做 **自回归预测 (autoregressive prediction)**：

$$
P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1})
$$

也就是说，第 $t$ 个 token **只能依赖之前的 token**，不能偷看未来。

* 举例：预测句子 “我今天去 \_\_\_”，模型在预测下一个词时，只能用“我 今天 去”，不能提前看到“北京”。

如果允许看未来 → 就会“作弊”，训练和推理不匹配，模型失效。

---

## 3. 怎么实现 Causal？

就是加一个 **下三角 mask**：

$$
\text{Mask}[i, j] =
\begin{cases} 
0 & j \leq i \quad (\text{可以看自己和之前的}) \\
-\infty & j > i \quad (\text{未来的 token 被屏蔽})
\end{cases}
$$

这样 softmax 后，未来 token 的注意力概率就是 0。

代码里就是：

```python
self.register_buffer("bias", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size))
                                 .view(1, 1, config.block_size, config.block_size))
...
att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))
```

---

## 4. 总结

* **Self-Attention**：每个位置可以注意到所有 token。
* **Causal Self-Attention**：每个位置 **只能注意到自己和之前的 token**，保证因果性，适合自回归语言建模（GPT 系列）。

---

👉 换句话说：

* Encoder 里的 Self-Attention 是 **双向**的（能看全局）。
* Decoder 里的 Self-Attention 是 **单向的（因果的）**，保证预测时不作弊。

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **普通 Self-Attention vs Causal Self-Attention 的对比图**（前者能看到未来，后者只能看过去），更直观？

```
class CausalSelfAttention(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        assert config.n_embd % config.n_head == 0
        # key, query, value projections for all heads, but in a batch
        self.c_attn = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, 3 * config.n_embd)
        # output projection
        self.c_proj = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.n_embd)
        # regularization
        self.n_head = config.n_head
        self.n_embd = config.n_embd
        # not really a 'bias', more of a mask, but following the OpenAI/HF naming though
        self.register_buffer("bias", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size))
                                     .view(1, 1, config.block_size, config.block_size))

    def forward(self, x):
        B, T, C = x.size() # batch size, sequence length, embedding dimensionality (n_embd)
        # calculate query, key, values for all heads in batch and move head forward to be the batch dim
        # nh is "number of heads", hs is "head size", and C (number of channels) = nh * hs
        # e.g. in GPT-2 (124M), n_head=12, hs=64, so nh*hs=C=768 channels in the Transformer
        qkv = self.c_attn(x)
        q, k, v = qkv.split(self.n_embd, dim=2)
        k = k.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        q = q.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        v = v.view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head).transpose(1, 2) # (B, nh, T, hs)
        # attention (materializes the large (T,T) matrix for all the queries and keys)
        att = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / math.sqrt(k.size(-1)))
        att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))
        att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)
        y = att @ v # (B, nh, T, T) x (B, nh, T, hs) -> (B, nh, T, hs)
        y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) # re-assemble all head outputs side by side
        # output projection
        y = self.c_proj(y)
        return y
```

好问题 👌
我们说的 **Causal Self-Attention**，其实就是在普通的 Self-Attention 基础上，加了一个 **因果约束 (causality constraint)**。

---

## 1. 普通 Self-Attention

在标准 Transformer（比如机器翻译的 Encoder）里，**每个 token 可以和序列中所有 token 交互**。

* 第 5 个词可以“看到”第 1\~10 个词；
* 第 3 个词也能看到第 4、5、6 … 后面的词。

这样没问题，因为在翻译任务里，整句话是已知的。

---

## 2. 为什么要加 Causal？

在 **语言模型 (LM, GPT)** 里，我们是做 **自回归预测 (autoregressive prediction)**：

$$
P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1})
$$

也就是说，第 $t$ 个 token **只能依赖之前的 token**，不能偷看未来。

* 举例：预测句子 “我今天去 \_\_\_”，模型在预测下一个词时，只能用“我 今天 去”，不能提前看到“北京”。

如果允许看未来 → 就会“作弊”，训练和推理不匹配，模型失效。

---

## 3. 怎么实现 Causal？

就是加一个 **下三角 mask**：

$$
\text{Mask}[i, j] =
\begin{cases} 
0 & j \leq i \quad (\text{可以看自己和之前的}) \\
-\infty & j > i \quad (\text{未来的 token 被屏蔽})
\end{cases}
$$

这样 softmax 后，未来 token 的注意力概率就是 0。

代码里就是：

```python
self.register_buffer("bias", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size))
                                 .view(1, 1, config.block_size, config.block_size))
...
att = att.masked_fill(self.bias[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))
```

---

## 4. 总结

* **Self-Attention**：每个位置可以注意到所有 token。
* **Causal Self-Attention**：每个位置 **只能注意到自己和之前的 token**，保证因果性，适合自回归语言建模（GPT 系列）。

---

👉 换句话说：

* Encoder 里的 Self-Attention 是 **双向**的（能看全局）。
* Decoder 里的 Self-Attention 是 **单向的（因果的）**，保证预测时不作弊。

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **普通 Self-Attention vs Causal Self-Attention 的对比图**（前者能看到未来，后者只能看过去），更直观？

# 介绍一下 contiguous()

好问题 👌 你提到的这一行：

```python
y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, T, C)
```

关键在于 **`contiguous()`**。

---

## 1. PyTorch 的张量内存布局

在 PyTorch 里，Tensor 在内存中是按行优先（row-major）的方式存储的。

* 大多数时候，Tensor 在内存里是连续存放的（contiguous）。
* 但是一些操作（比如 `transpose`, `permute`, `narrow`）不会真正移动数据，而是通过修改 **stride**（步长）来“重新解释”张量。

👉 这样做更高效，但导致内存不是连续的。

---

## 2. 什么是 `contiguous()`

当一个 Tensor 在内存中不是连续的时，调用 `.contiguous()` 会：

* **拷贝数据**，让它在内存中变成一个真正连续存储的副本；
* 返回这个新的 Tensor。

---

## 3. 为什么这里要用 `contiguous()`

```python
y = y.transpose(1, 2)   # 改变了维度顺序，但内存不连续
y = y.contiguous()      # 让内存变成连续存放
y = y.view(B, T, C)     # reshape 成目标形状
```

* `transpose(1, 2)` 后的张量只是 stride 改变了，并没有实际调换内存里的数据。
* 如果直接 `.view(B, T, C)`，PyTorch 可能会报错（因为 `view` 要求底层内存是连续的）。
* `contiguous()` 就是为了保证接下来的 `view` 可以安全执行。

---

## 4. 小例子

```python
import torch

x = torch.arange(12).view(3, 4)
print(x.is_contiguous())   # True

y = x.transpose(0, 1)
print(y.is_contiguous())   # False (因为只是换了stride)

z = y.contiguous()
print(z.is_contiguous())   # True
```

---

## ✅ 总结

* `.contiguous()` 用于把一个 **非连续的张量（通常由 transpose/permute 得到）** 拷贝成 **内存连续的张量**。
* 在代码里，它的作用是：**保证 `view` 能正确 reshape**。

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **张量内存布局（contiguous vs non-contiguous）** 的图，直观展示为什么需要 `contiguous()`？

# loading the huggingface/GPT-2 parameters

so here I've also changed the GPT config so that the numbers here the H parameters agree with the gpt2 124 M
model so the maximum sequence length which I call block size here is 124 the
number of tokens is 50250 257 which if you watch my tokenizer video know that
this is 50,000 m merges BP merges 256 bite tokens the leaves of the BP tree
and one special end of text token that delimits different documents and can start generation as well and there are
12 layers there are 12 heads in the attention and the dimension of the Transformers was
768 so here's how we can now load the parameters from hugging face to uh our
code here and initialize the GPT class with those parameters so let me just copy paste a bunch of code
here and I'm not going to go through this code too slow too quickly too slowly because um honestly it's not that
interesting it's not that exciting we're just loading the weights so it's kind of dry but as I mentioned there are four
models in this miniseries of gpt2 this is some of the Jupiter code um code that
we had here on the right I'm just pting it over these are the hyper parameters of the gpt2 models uh we're creating the
config object and creating our own model and then what's Happening Here is we're creating the state dict both for our
model and for the hugging face model um and then what we're doing here
is we're going over the hugging face model keys and we're copying over those
tensors and in the process we are kind of ignoring a few of the buffers they're not parameters they're buffers so for
example attention dobias uh that's just used for the autoaggressive mask and so we are ignoring some of those masks and
uh that's it and then then one additional kind of annoyance is that this comes from the tensorflow repo and
I'm not sure how this is a little bit annoying but some of the weights are transposed from what pytorch would want
and so manually I hardcoded the weights that should be transposed and then we transpose them if that is so and then we
return this model so the from pre-trained is a Constructor or class method in Python
that Returns the GPT object if we just give it the model type which in our case
is gpt2 the smallest model that we're interested in so this is the code and this is how you would use it and um we
can pop open the terminal here in vs code and we can python train gbt2 pi and
fingers crossed okay so we didn't crash and so
we can load the weights and the biases and everything else into our Ann module
but now let's also get additional confidence that this is working and let's try to actually generate from this model okay now before we can actually

## 加载 Hugging Face GPT-2 的参数

在这一部分，我们修改了 GPT-2 的配置，使得它的超参数（H 参数）与 GPT-2 124M 模型相匹配。具体来说：

* **最大序列长度（block size）** 设置为 124（也就是 GPT-2 能处理的最大 token 数量）；
* **词表大小（vocab size）** 为 50257，这个数字对应 GPT-2 的词汇表，其中包括了 50,000 个通过 Byte Pair Encoding（BP）合并的词汇、256 字节的 token 以及一个特殊的 **end-of-text** token，用来标识文档的结束并可以作为生成的起始标记；
* 模型有 **12 层** Transformer，每层有 **12 个 Attention heads**，每个头的维度是 **768**。

---

### 如何加载 Hugging Face 模型参数

接下来，我们使用以下代码加载 Hugging Face 中预训练的 GPT-2 参数，并将它们初始化到我们自己的 GPT 模型类中。虽然这部分的代码比较简单（主要是加载权重），但为了清楚起见，我们还是看一下整体过程：

1. 我们定义了一些超参数（如词汇大小、层数等）；
2. 创建了模型的 **config 对象** 和 **GPT 模型**；
3. 创建了模型的 **state dict**，这实际上是一个包含所有权重（和一些偏置）的字典；
4. 然后，我们从 Hugging Face 的预训练模型中读取权重，逐个将其复制到我们自己的模型中。

需要注意的是：

* 有一些 **buffer**（缓冲区）我们不需要加载，因为它们不是模型的参数，比如在自回归（autoregressive）掩码中使用的 `attention_dobias`。
* 有些权重需要转置，因为 Hugging Face 的模型是用 TensorFlow 实现的，而我们的代码用的是 PyTorch。虽然大部分权重可以直接加载，但有些需要手动调整其维度顺序，因此我们手动对这些需要转置的权重进行了处理。

---

### 加载模型并生成文本

通过上述过程，我们成功地将 Hugging Face 的预训练权重加载到我们定义的模型中，并初始化了模型。接下来，我们可以进一步验证模型是否正常工作：

* 我们可以运行一个 Python 脚本（如 `train_gpt2.py`），检查模型是否能够正确加载权重并顺利启动；
* 如果模型能够加载而不崩溃，就说明我们的模型和权重加载部分成功。

然后，为了进一步确认模型工作正常，我们还可以测试 **文本生成**。我们可以输入一个提示（如 "Hello, I'm a language model,"）并观察模型是否能够生成连贯的文本。

---

总结来说，这部分的工作主要是加载并初始化模型权重，并进行一些必要的调整，确保 PyTorch 和 TensorFlow 之间的兼容性。接下来，我们就可以尝试使用这个加载好的模型来生成文本。

---

                    sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k])

        return model
```

这段代码实现的是：**把 HuggingFace 的预训练 GPT-2 权重加载到自己实现的 GPT 类中**。
我们逐块拆开来看：

---

## 1. 方法定义

```python
@classmethod
def from_pretrained(cls, model_type):
    """Loads pretrained GPT-2 model weights from huggingface"""
```

* 定义了一个类方法，用于构造 GPT 对象，并直接加载指定大小的 GPT-2 预训练权重。
* `model_type` 必须是 HuggingFace 支持的 GPT-2 模型之一：`gpt2, gpt2-medium, gpt2-large, gpt2-xl`。

---

## 2. 模型配置

```python
config_args = {
    'gpt2':         dict(n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768),  # 124M params
    'gpt2-medium':  dict(n_layer=24, n_head=16, n_embd=1024), # 350M params
    'gpt2-large':   dict(n_layer=36, n_head=20, n_embd=1280), # 774M params
    'gpt2-xl':      dict(n_layer=48, n_head=25, n_embd=1600), # 1558M params
}[model_type]
config_args['vocab_size'] = 50257 # GPT-2 固定词表大小
config_args['block_size'] = 1024  # GPT-2 固定上下文长度
```

* 根据不同的 `model_type`，设置 Transformer 的层数、头数和 embedding 维度。
* 词表大小和最大上下文长度在 GPT-2 里是固定的。

---

## 3. 初始化一个自己写的 GPT 模型

```python
config = GPTConfig(**config_args)
model = GPT(config)
sd = model.state_dict()
sd_keys = sd.keys()
sd_keys = [k for k in sd_keys if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')]
```

* 用这些参数创建一个自己实现的 `GPT` 模型（从头随机初始化）。
* `state_dict()` 返回模型参数字典。
* 去掉 `attn.bias` 这种 buffer（只是 mask，不是需要训练的参数）。

---

## 4. 初始化 HuggingFace 的 GPT-2 模型

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel
model_hf = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_type)
sd_hf = model_hf.state_dict()
```

* 从 HuggingFace 加载对应的 GPT-2 权重。
* `state_dict()` 得到 HuggingFace 模型的参数字典。

---

## 5. 处理 key 对齐

```python
sd_keys_hf = sd_hf.keys()
sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.masked_bias')]
sd_keys_hf = [k for k in sd_keys_hf if not k.endswith('.attn.bias')]
```

* HuggingFace 的 state\_dict 里有一些 buffer（mask），这里也过滤掉，保证参数数量一致。

---

## 6. 处理 Conv1D 与 Linear 的区别

```python
transposed = ['attn.c_attn.weight', 'attn.c_proj.weight',
              'mlp.c_fc.weight', 'mlp.c_proj.weight']
```

* OpenAI 原版 GPT-2 用的是 `Conv1D` 实现（其实就是带转置的线性层），而我们实现的 GPT 用 `nn.Linear`。
* 所以有些权重需要转置一下才能对齐。

---

## 7. 拷贝参数

```python
for k in sd_keys_hf:
    if any(k.endswith(w) for w in transposed):
        assert sd_hf[k].shape[::-1] == sd[k].shape
        with torch.no_grad():
            sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k].t())  # 转置后拷贝
    else:
        assert sd_hf[k].shape == sd[k].shape
        with torch.no_grad():
            sd[k].copy_(sd_hf[k])      # 直接拷贝
```

* 遍历 HuggingFace 的权重。
* 如果是需要转置的权重，就 `.t()` 转置后再拷贝；否则直接拷贝。
* 用 `torch.no_grad()` 避免影响梯度计算。

---

## 8. 返回模型

```python
return model
```

* 最终返回一个加载了 HuggingFace 预训练权重的自定义 GPT 模型。

---

## ✅ 总结

这个方法做的事是：

1. 根据 `model_type` 创建一个自己写的 GPT 模型（结构一致，但随机初始化）。
2. 从 HuggingFace 下载预训练好的 GPT-2 权重。
3. 对齐并拷贝参数（部分权重需要转置）。
4. 返回加载好预训练参数的 GPT 模型。

---

👉 简单说，它是一个 **桥接器**，让你写的 `GPT` 类可以直接用 HuggingFace 的预训练权重，而不用从零训练。

要不要我帮你画一个 **流程图（HuggingFace GPT-2 → 权重对齐 → 自己的 GPT 类）**，让整体过程更直观？


# config = GPTConfig(**config_args) 解释一下**

好 👌 我来拆解这一句：

```python
config = GPTConfig(**config_args)
```

---

## 1. `**` 在 Python 里的含义

* `**dict` 语法表示 **字典解包 (dictionary unpacking)**。
* 会把字典里的 **key-value 对展开**，作为关键字参数传给函数/类。

举个例子：

```python
def foo(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

args = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
foo(**args)   # 相当于 foo(a=1, b=2, c=3)
```

所以：

```python
GPTConfig(**config_args)
```

等价于：

```python
GPTConfig(n_layer=..., n_head=..., n_embd=..., vocab_size=..., block_size=...)
```

---

## 2. 在你的代码里

`config_args` 是一个字典，比如：

```python
config_args = {
    'n_layer': 12,
    'n_head': 12,
    'n_embd': 768,
    'vocab_size': 50257,
    'block_size': 1024
}
```

那么：

```python
config = GPTConfig(**config_args)
```

就是在调用 `GPTConfig` 构造函数时，传入这些配置参数。

---

## 3. 为什么要用 `**`

* **更简洁**：不用一行行写 `GPTConfig(n_layer=config_args['n_layer'], ...)`。
* **更灵活**：如果字典里参数更多或有变化，不需要改调用代码。
* **通用性**：可以很方便地从 JSON / YAML / dict 里加载参数，再用 `**` 传给类。

---

✅ **总结**
`**config_args` 的作用是把一个字典里的键值对展开，作为关键字参数传给 `GPTConfig`。
这行代码的意思是：**根据 `config_args` 里的参数创建一个 GPTConfig 配置对象**。

---

要不要我帮你把 `*args` 和 `**kwargs` 的区别也讲一下？这样你能把这个语法掌握透彻。


# implementing the forward pass to get logits

generate from this model we have to be able to forward it we didn't actually write that code yet so here's the
forward function so the input to the forward is going to be our indices our tokens uh
token indices and they are always of shape B BYT and so we have batch
dimension of B and then we have the time dimension of up to T and the T can't be
more than the block size the block size is is the maximum sequence length so B BYT indices arranged is sort of like a
two-dimensional layout and remember that basically every single row of this is of size up to uh block size and this is T
tokens that are in a sequence and then we have B independent sequences stacked up in a batch so that this is
efficient now here we are forwarding the position embeddings and the token embeddings and this code should be very
recognizable from the previous lecture so um we basically use uh a range which
is kind of like a version of range but for pytorch uh and we're iterating from Z to T and creating this uh positions uh
sort of uh indices um and then we are making sure that
they're in the same device as idx because we're not going to be training on only CPU that's going to be too inefficient we want to be training on
GPU and that's going to come in in a bit uh then we have the position embeddings and the token embeddings and
the addition operation of those two now notice that the position embed are going to be identical for every single row of

create an additional Dimension here and then these two add up because the same position embeddings apply at every
single row of our example stacked up in a batch then we forward the Transformer blocks and finally the last layer norm

was B BYT indices then at every single B by T we will calculate the uh logits for
what token comes next in the sequence so what is the token B t+1 the one on the
right of this token and B app size here is the number of possible tokens and so
therefore this is the tensor that we're going to obtain and these low jits are just a softmax away from becoming
probabilities so this is the forward pass of the network and now we can get load and so we're going to be able to

## 实现前向传播（Forward Pass）以获得 Logits

为了从模型中生成文本，我们必须实现前向传播（Forward Pass）函数，这个函数将计算 **logits**（即预测下一个 token 的未归一化概率）。

### 输入数据格式

* **输入**：模型的输入是 token 的 **索引**，也就是一组数字表示的 token 序列，形状是 `[B, T]`，其中：

  * `B` 是 **批次大小（batch size）**，表示每次训练中处理的独立序列数；
  * `T` 是 **时间维度（time dimension）**，即每个序列的长度，最多为 `block_size`（模型能够处理的最大序列长度）。

  这样，输入的形状就变成了一个二维张量，大小为 `[B, T]`，其中每一行对应一个序列，每一列对应一个 token 的索引。

### 处理位置和 token 嵌入（Embedding）

* 我们将 **token 嵌入（token embeddings）** 和 **位置嵌入（position embeddings）** 相加，得到每个 token 的最终表示。
* 对于 **位置嵌入**，每个位置的嵌入是相同的，这意味着对于每一行（即每个序列），**位置嵌入是广播的**，这也就是为什么我们需要添加一个额外的维度来实现广播。
* 通过这种方式，每个 token 都会有一个 **位置编码** 和 **词嵌入**，它们相加形成最终的输入表示。

### 前向传播过程

1. **前向传播位置嵌入和 token 嵌入**：首先，我们将 token 索引转化为 token 嵌入，并加上位置嵌入。
2. **通过 Transformer 块**：然后，这些加和后的嵌入会传递到 Transformer 的各个 **Block** 中进行处理。每个 Block 包含多头自注意力（Self-Attention）和前馈网络（Feed-forward Network）。
3. **最后的 LayerNorm 和 LM Head**：经过 Transformer 处理后，最后会经过一个 **LayerNorm** 和一个 **语言模型头（LM Head）**，即一个线性层，将 Transformer 输出的维度映射到词汇表大小，生成 logits。

### 输出结果

* **输出**：最终的输出是 **logits**，它的形状是 `[B, T, vocab_size]`，即每个序列的每个 token 都有一个与词汇表大小相等的向量，表示预测下一个 token 的概率分布。
* **logits 变为概率**：通过对这些 logits 进行 **softmax** 操作，我们可以得到下一个 token 的概率分布，从而进行采样生成文本。

### 总结

前向传播的过程非常简单：

1. 输入是一个 `[B, T]` 的 token 索引；
2. 通过位置嵌入和 token 嵌入相加，得到输入表示；
3. 通过 Transformer 模型进行处理，得到 logits；
4. logits 可以通过 softmax 转化为概率，用于生成下一个 token。

通过这个前向传播函数，我们就可以计算出每个位置的预测，最终实现文本生成。

        pos_emb = self.transformer.wpe(pos) # position embeddings of shape (T, n_embd)
        tok_emb = self.transformer.wte(idx) # token embeddings of shape (B, T, n_embd)
        x = tok_emb + pos_emb
        # forward the blocks of the transformer
        for block in self.transformer.h:
            x = block(x)
        # forward the final layernorm and the classifier
        x = self.transformer.ln_f(x)
        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
        return logits
```


好问题 👍
这段代码是 **GPT 模型的前向传播 (forward pass)**，它从输入的 token id 计算出预测的下一个 token 概率。逐行解析如下：

---

## 1. 输入与检查

```python
def forward(self, idx):
    # idx is of shape (B, T)
    B, T = idx.size()
    assert T <= self.config.block_size, f"Cannot forward sequence of length {T}, block size is only {self.config.block_size}"
```

* 输入 `idx` 是一个整型张量，形状 `(B, T)`：

  * `B` = batch size
  * `T` = 序列长度
* 例如，`idx` 可能是：

  ```
  [[ 502,  123,  345, ...],
   [  76,   11, 9873, ...]]
  ```
* `assert` 用来保证序列长度 `T` 不超过模型支持的最大上下文长度 `block_size`（GPT-2 固定 1024）。

---

## 2. 位置索引与 embedding

```python
pos = torch.arange(0, T, dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device) # shape (T)
pos_emb = self.transformer.wpe(pos) # (T, n_embd)
tok_emb = self.transformer.wte(idx) # (B, T, n_embd)
x = tok_emb + pos_emb
```

* `pos`: 生成 `[0, 1, 2, ..., T-1]`，表示序列中每个 token 的位置。
* `wpe`: 位置 embedding (position embedding)，输出 `(T, n_embd)`。
* `wte`: 词 embedding (word token embedding)，把 `idx` 的 token id 映射为向量，输出 `(B, T, n_embd)`。
* `x = tok_emb + pos_emb`:

  * 把词向量和位置向量相加，得到带有位置信息的 token 表示。
  * PyTorch 会广播 `(T, n_embd)` → `(B, T, n_embd)`。

---

## 3. Transformer blocks

```python
for block in self.transformer.h:
    x = block(x)
```

* `self.transformer.h` 是一个 `nn.ModuleList`，包含多层 Transformer Block。
* 每个 `block` 内部就是：

  * 多头自注意力 (Causal Self-Attention)
  * 前馈网络 (Feed Forward, MLP)
  * 残差连接 + LayerNorm
* 每一层都会更新 token 表示，使它能融合上下文信息。

---

## 4. 最后的 LayerNorm

```python
x = self.transformer.ln_f(x)
```

* 在 Transformer 的最后加 LayerNorm，稳定训练。
* 输出形状仍是 `(B, T, n_embd)`。

---

## 5. 语言模型头 (lm\_head)

```python
logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
return logits
```

* `lm_head` 是一个 `nn.Linear(n_embd, vocab_size)`。
* 输入：`(B, T, n_embd)`
* 输出：`(B, T, vocab_size)`
* 每个位置 `t` 都会预测下一个 token 的概率分布（softmax 之后）。

---

## ✅ 总结

整体流程是：

```
idx (B,T) → token embedding (B,T,n_embd)
          + position embedding (T,n_embd)
          ↓
多层 Transformer block (contextualized representation)
          ↓
LayerNorm
          ↓
lm_head Linear → (B,T,vocab_size)
```

**输出 logits**：是模型对每个时间步、每个词的预测分数，softmax 后就是概率。

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **数据流 shape 变化图**（从 idx → embedding → transformer → lm\_head → logits）？这样你会更直观地看到每一步的维度变化。


# idx.shape和idx.size()的区别

好问题 👍
在 PyTorch 里，**`tensor.shape` 和 `tensor.size()` 本质上几乎一样**，但有一些小区别：

---

## 1. 相同点

* 都能返回张量的维度信息。
* 对于一个形状 `(B, T)` 的张量：

  ```python
  idx.shape   # 返回 torch.Size([B, T])
  idx.size()  # 返回 torch.Size([B, T])
  ```

  两者结果是一样的。

---

## 2. 区别

* **`tensor.shape`**

  * 更“Pythonic”，写法简洁。
  * 直接是 `torch.Size` 对象（其实就是一个 tuple 的子类）。
  * 一般在调试或快速取维度时用，比如 `x.shape[0]`。

* **`tensor.size()`**

  * 是一个方法（调用函数）。
  * 和 `shape` 返回一样的东西。
  * 还支持 `tensor.size(dim)`，直接取某一维：

    ```python
    idx.size(0)  # B
    idx.size(1)  # T
    ```

---

## 3. 小例子

```python
import torch

x = torch.zeros(3, 5)

print(x.shape)      # torch.Size([3, 5])
print(x.size())     # torch.Size([3, 5])
print(x.size(0))    # 3
print(x.size(1))    # 5
```

---

## ✅ 总结

* `tensor.shape` 和 `tensor.size()` 结果一样，返回 **torch.Size**（可以当 tuple 用）。
* **`size(dim)`** 是 `size()` 独有的功能，可以直接取某一维。
* 在现代 PyTorch 代码里，大家常用 `.shape`，因为更简洁。

---

要不要我帮你对比一下 **`.shape`、`.size()`、`len(tensor)`** 在取维度时的差异？

# 解释一下 idx.device

```
pos = torch.arange(0, T, dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device) # shape (T)
```

很好 👌 你提到的这一行：

```python
pos = torch.arange(0, T, dtype=torch.long, device=idx.device)
```

关键在于 **`idx.device`**。

---

## 1. 什么是 `.device`

* 在 PyTorch 中，**每个 Tensor 都有一个设备属性**，表示它当前存放在 **CPU** 还是 **GPU**（哪块 GPU）。
* 你可以通过 `.device` 查看：

  ```python
  x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])
  print(x.device)   # cpu

  x = torch.tensor([1,2,3], device="cuda:0")
  print(x.device)   # cuda:0  (表示在第0块GPU)
  ```

---

## 2. 为什么要写 `device=idx.device`

* 这行代码创建了一个位置序列 `pos = [0, 1, 2, ..., T-1]`。
* 如果 `idx` 在 GPU 上，而 `pos` 默认在 CPU 上，就会出现 **跨设备计算报错**：

  ```
  RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device
  ```
* 写成 `device=idx.device`，能保证 `pos` 和 `idx` 在同一个设备上。

  * 如果 `idx` 在 CPU，`pos` 也在 CPU。
  * 如果 `idx` 在 GPU:0，`pos` 也在 GPU:0。

这样就避免了不必要的数据传输和报错。

---

## 3. 小例子

```python
idx = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 5), device="cuda:0")  # idx 在 GPU
print(idx.device)  # cuda:0

pos = torch.arange(0, idx.size(1), device=idx.device)
print(pos.device)  # cuda:0
```

---

✅ **总结**

* `idx.device` 表示张量 `idx` 当前所在的设备（CPU 或某块 GPU）。
* 在 `torch.arange(..., device=idx.device)` 里，用它来确保生成的张量 `pos` 和 `idx` 在同一个设备上，避免跨设备计算错误。

---

要不要我顺便帮你整理一下 PyTorch 里 **Tensor 跨设备移动的方法**（比如 `.to()`, `.cuda()`, `.cpu()`）？


# sampling init, prefix tokens, tokenization

left here that matches hug and face on the right so here we've sampled from the pipeline and we sampled five times up to
30 tokens with the prefix of hello I'm a language model and these are the completions that we achieved so we're
going to try to replicate that on the left here so number turn sequences is five max length is 30 so the first thing
we do of course is we initialize our model then we put it into evaluation mode now this is a good practice to put
the model into eval when you're not going to be training it you're just going to be using it and I don't
actually know if this is doing anything right now for the following reason our model up above here contains no modules
or layers that actually have a different uh Behavior at training or evaluation time so for example Dropout batch norm
and a bunch of other layers have this kind of behavior but all of these layers that we've used here should be identical
in both training and evaluation time um so so potentially model that eval does
nothing but then I'm not actually sure if this is the case and maybe pytorch internals uh do some clever things
depending on the evaluation mode uh inside here the next thing we're doing here is we are moving the entire model
to Cuda so we're moving this all of the tensors to GPU so I'm sshed here to a
cloud box and I have a bunch of gpus on this box and here I'm moving the entire
model and all of its members and all of its tensors and everything like that everything gets shipped off to basically
a whole separate computer that is sitting on the GPU and the GPU is connected to the uh CPU and they can
communicate but it's basically a whole separate computer with its own computer architecture and it's really well catered to parallel processing tasks
like those of running neural networks so I'm doing this so that the model lives on the GPU a whole separate computer and
it's just going to make our code a lot more efficient because all of this stuff runs a lot more efficiently on the
gpus so that's the model itself now uh the next thing we want to
do is we want to start with this as the prefix when we do the generation so
let's actually create those prefix tokens so here's the code that I've written we're going to import the tich
token library from open Ai and we're going to get the gpt2 encoding so that's the tokenizer for gpt2 and then we're
going to encode this string and get a list of integers which are the tokens uh
now these integers here should actually be fairly straightforward because we can just copy paste this string and we can
sort of inspect what it is in tick tokenizer so just pasting that in these are the tokens that are going to come
out so this list of integers is what we expect tokens to become and as you
recall if you saw my video of course all the tokens they're just little string chunks right so these are this is the
chunc of this string into gpt2 tokens so once we have those tokens it's
a list of integers we can create a torch tensor out of it in this case it's eight tokens and then we're going to replicate
these eight tokens for five times to get five rows of eight tokens and that is
our initial um input X as I call it here and it lives on the GPU as well so X now
is this idx that we can put into forward to get our logits so that we know what
comes as the sixth token uh sorry as the ninth token in every one
of these five rows okay and we are now ready to generate so let me paste in one more code block

当然，以下是这段内容的中文解释：

## 采样初始化、前缀 tokens 和分词（Tokenization）

在这部分，我们要模拟从 Hugging Face 的 GPT-2 模型生成文本的过程，并尽量复制出类似的效果。我们从一个给定的前缀（如“Hello, I'm a language model”）开始，然后生成最多 30 个 tokens。

### 1. 初始化模型和设置评估模式

首先，我们 **初始化模型**，然后将其切换到 **评估模式（eval）**：

* 这是一个好的实践，当你不再训练模型，只是用它进行推理时，将模型设置为评估模式。
* 但是，需要注意的是：我们的模型中没有使用任何在训练和评估时表现不同的层（例如 Dropout 或 BatchNorm）。这些层在训练和评估时的行为是不同的，但我们这里使用的层在两种模式下都是相同的。因此，将模型设置为 `eval()` 可能不会做任何改变，但为了确保最佳实践，还是调用了这个函数。

### 2. 将模型迁移到 GPU

接下来，我们将模型和所有参数转移到 **GPU** 上：

* 我们通过 SSH 连接到云端服务器，并将模型迁移到 GPU 上。
* GPU 是专门设计来处理神经网络这种大规模并行计算任务的，所以我们将整个模型移动到 GPU 上能显著提高效率。
* 这样，所有的计算就会在 GPU 上完成，能加速训练和推理过程。

### 3. 创建前缀 tokens

接下来，我们要用 **GPT-2 的分词器** 来将前缀文本（如“Hello, I'm a language model”）转化为 token：

* 我们使用 OpenAI 提供的 `tiktoken` 库来获取 GPT-2 的分词器，并将文本字符串编码成对应的 token。

* 通过编码，我们得到一组整数，每个整数代表一个 token。你可以把这些整数理解为将字符串拆分成的小块（token）。

  例如，前缀“Hello, I'm a language model” 会被拆分成一系列的 token，这些 token 会被转换成整数表示。例如：

  * `"Hello"` → `token_id_1`
  * `","` → `token_id_2`
  * `"I'm"` → `token_id_3`
  * 依此类推...

* 然后，我们将这些整数转换为 PyTorch 张量（tensor），并把它们放到 GPU 上。

### 4. 初始化输入并准备生成

* 我们将生成的 token 列表（例如 8 个 token）**复制 5 次**，这样就得到了 5 行，每行包含相同的前缀 tokens。这样，我们就创建了一个大小为 `[5, 8]` 的张量，代表 5 个独立的输入序列，每个序列包含 8 个 token。
* 这个张量就是我们的 **初始输入**，并且它也存储在 GPU 上。

### 5. 前向传播生成 logits

* 接下来，我们将这些 token 索引作为输入传递给模型，并通过前向传播（`forward()`）获得 **logits**。
* logits 是模型对每个 token 位置上下一个 token 的预测，表示的是“下一个 token 是什么”的未归一化概率。

通过这些 logits，我们可以得到下一个 token 的概率分布，从而进行采样。

---

总之，整个过程的核心是：

1. 将输入文本转化为 token 并生成输入张量；
2. 将模型和数据迁移到 GPU 上；
3. 使用前缀 tokens 初始化生成过程，并进行前向传播计算 logits。

通过这个过程，我们就能从模型中生成连贯的文本。

---

如果你需要进一步了解如何实现后续的文本生成，或者如何处理 logits 转化为概率进行采样，请随时告诉我！

```
model = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model.eval()
model.to('cuda')

# prefix tokens
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, I'm a language model,")
tokens = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long) # (8,)
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1) # (5, 8)
x = tokens.to('cuda')

# generate! right now x is (B, T) where B = 5, T = 8
# set the seed to 42
torch.manual_seed(42)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)
while x.size(1) < max_length:
    # forward the model to get the logits
    with torch.no_grad():
        logits = model(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
        # take the logits at the last position
        logits = logits[:, -1, :] # (B, vocab_size)
        # get the probabilities
        probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        # do top-k sampling of 50 (huggingface pipeline default)
        # topk_probs here becomes (5, 50), topk_indices is (5, 50)
        topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, 50, dim=-1)
        # select a token from the top-k probabilities
        # note: multinomial does not demand the input to sum to 1
        ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1) # (B, 1)
        # gather the corresponding indices
        xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix) # (B, 1)
        # append to the sequence
        x = torch.cat((x, xcol), dim=1)

# print the generated text
for i in range(num_return_sequences):
    tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()
    decoded = enc.decode(tokens)
    print(">", decoded)
```

非常棒的问题 👍 你贴的这段代码其实就是在用你自己实现的 **GPT + HuggingFace 预训练权重**做 **文本生成 (Text Generation)**，而且还加了 **Top-k 采样**。我来逐步解释：

---

## 1. 加载模型

```python
model = GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model.eval()
model.to('cuda')
```

* `GPT.from_pretrained('gpt2')`：用我们自己实现的 `from_pretrained` 方法，加载 HuggingFace 的 GPT-2 预训练参数。
* `model.eval()`：设置成推理模式（关闭 dropout 等训练相关操作）。
* `model.to('cuda')`：把模型放到 GPU 上。

---

## 2. 准备输入 tokens

```python
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, I'm a language model,") # 编码成 token id
tokens = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long) # shape (8,)
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1) # (5, 8)
x = tokens.to('cuda')
```

* 用 `tiktoken` 对字符串编码，得到 GPT-2 的 token 序列（8 个 token）。
* `unsqueeze(0)` → 从 `(8,)` 变成 `(1, 8)`。
* `.repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)` → 复制 5 份，得到 `(5, 8)`。

  * `B=5` 表示生成 5 个不同样本。
  * `T=8` 表示前缀序列长度为 8。
* `x.to('cuda')` → 把输入放到 GPU 上。

---

## 3. 生成循环

```python
torch.manual_seed(42)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)
while x.size(1) < max_length:
```

* 设置随机种子，保证可复现。
* 循环直到生成长度达到 `max_length`。

---

## 4. 前向推理，取最后位置 logits

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(x) # (B, T, vocab_size)
    logits = logits[:, -1, :] # (B, vocab_size)
```

* `model(x)`：输出预测分布 `(B, T, vocab_size)`。
* `logits[:, -1, :]`：只取序列最后一个位置的预测，shape = `(B, vocab_size)`。

  * 因为我们要预测下一个 token。

---

## 5. Softmax + Top-k 采样

```python
probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1) # (B, vocab_size)
topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, 50, dim=-1) # (B, 50)
```

* `softmax` → 把 logits 转换为概率分布。
* `topk(50)` → 只保留概率最高的 50 个 token（Top-k 策略，避免低概率词破坏结果）。

```python
ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1) # (B, 1)
xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix) # (B, 1)
```

* `torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1)` → 按照概率随机采样 1 个 token 索引（在 Top-50 里）。
* `torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix)` → 把采样到的索引还原成真正的 token id。

---

## 6. 拼接到输入序列

```python
x = torch.cat((x, xcol), dim=1)  # (B, T+1)
```

* 把新生成的 token 拼到序列末尾，进入下一轮循环。

---

## 7. 输出结果

```python
for i in range(num_return_sequences):
    tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()
    decoded = enc.decode(tokens)
    print(">", decoded)
```

* 对 5 个生成结果逐一解码，输出最终文本。

---

## ✅ 总结

这段代码完整实现了 **自回归文本生成**：

1. **准备输入**：把前缀 `"Hello, I'm a language model,"` 编码成 tokens。
2. **迭代生成**：每次喂入序列 → 得到最后 token 的预测分布 → Top-k 策略 → 随机采样一个 token → 拼接到序列。
3. **循环**：直到达到 `max_length`。
4. **解码输出**：把 token id 转回字符串。

---

👉 直白一点：
这就是 HuggingFace `pipeline("text-generation")` 的手工实现版本，只不过你自己控制了 logits、softmax、top-k、采样这些细节。

要不要我帮你画一个 **生成循环的流程图**（从输入 → logits → softmax → top-k → 采样 → 拼接 → 循环 → 输出文本），让流程更直观？

```python
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, I'm a language model,")
```

* `enc.encode(...)` 会把文本转成 **token id 列表**，比如：

  ```python
  [15496, 11, 314, 257, 5766, 1158, 11]
  ```
* 这是一个 Python **list**，长度是 8（所以 shape = `(8,)`）。

---

## 2. 转成 PyTorch Tensor

```python
torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.long)
```

* `torch.tensor(list, dtype=...)` 会把 Python 列表转换成 **PyTorch 张量**。
* `dtype=torch.long` 表示用 **64 位整数**（`int64`），这是 PyTorch 里 embedding 层常用的索引类型（token id 必须是 long 类型）。
* 转换后就是：

  ```python
  tensor([15496,    11,   314,   257,  5766,  1158,    11, ...], dtype=torch.int64)
  ```
* shape 是 `(8,)`，即一维张量，长度为 8。

---

## 3. 为什么必须用 `long` 类型？

* 在 PyTorch 里，`nn.Embedding` 的输入必须是 `torch.long` 或 `torch.int64` 类型。
* 如果是 `float32` 或 `int32` 会报错。
* 所以这里显式指定 `dtype=torch.long`，保证 token 可以正确传入 embedding 层。

---

✅ **总结**
这行代码做了两件事：

1. 把 HuggingFace 的 token id 列表（Python list）转换成 PyTorch 张量。
2. 指定为 `torch.long` 类型（int64），因为 embedding 需要整数索引。
3. 最终得到一个形状 `(8,)` 的张量，表示一句话的 8 个 token。

---

要不要我顺便给你解释一下接下来那行：

```python
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)  # (5, 8)
```

为什么要这样扩展维度、复制成 `(5, 8)`？


```
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)  # (5, 8)
```

好 👍 我来解释这一行：

```python
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0).repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)  # (5, 8)
```

---

## 1. 前一步

此时 `tokens` 是：

```python
tensor([15496,    11,   314,   257,  5766,  1158,    11, ...], dtype=torch.int64)
```

* shape = `(8,)`，表示一句话的 8 个 token id。
* 但模型的输入一般是 **二维张量** `(B, T)`：

  * `B` = batch size
  * `T` = 序列长度

---

## 2. `unsqueeze(0)`

```python
tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0)
```

* 在 **第 0 维**增加一个维度：

  * 原来 `(8,)` → 变成 `(1, 8)`
* 相当于告诉模型：我们现在有 **1 个样本，长度为 8**。

---

## 3. `.repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)`

```python
tokens = tokens.repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)
```

* 把 `(1, 8)` 的张量沿着第 0 维（batch 维）复制 `num_return_sequences` 次。
* 如果 `num_return_sequences = 5`：

  * `(1, 8)` → `(5, 8)`
  * 相当于复制了 5 份相同的前缀序列。

---

## 4. 为什么要这样做？

因为我们希望用 **同一个前缀** 生成 **多个不同的序列**（通过随机采样保证多样性）。

* 如果只用 `(1, 8)`，只能生成 1 个结果。
* 用 `(5, 8)`，模型就能并行生成 5 个结果，每个结果在后续的 top-k 采样里可能会不同。

---

## 5. 举例

```python
tokens = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30])
print(tokens.shape)   # (3,)

tokens = tokens.unsqueeze(0)
print(tokens.shape)   # (1, 3)

tokens = tokens.repeat(5, 1)
print(tokens.shape)   # (5, 3)
print(tokens)
# tensor([[10, 20, 30],
#         [10, 20, 30],
#         [10, 20, 30],
#         [10, 20, 30],
#         [10, 20, 30]])
```

---

✅ **总结**
这行代码的作用是：

1. `unsqueeze(0)` → 把一维 token 序列 `(8,)` 变成 `(1, 8)`，加上 batch 维。
2. `repeat(num_return_sequences, 1)` → 复制多份，得到 `(5, 8)`，可以一次生成 5 个不同结果。

---

要不要我帮你把 `(8,) → (1,8) → (5,8)` 的维度变化画成一个小示意图？

```
logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # (B, vocab_size)
```

好 👌 我来解释这一行：

```python
logits = logits[:, -1, :]  # (B, vocab_size)
```

---

## 1. 上一步输出是什么？

前面 `model(x)` 的输出是：

```python
logits = model(x)   # (B, T, vocab_size)
```

* **形状 (B, T, vocab\_size)**

  * `B` = batch size
  * `T` = 当前序列长度
  * `vocab_size` = 词表大小 (50257 for GPT-2)
* 含义：模型对序列中 **每个位置的 token** 都给出了一个预测分布。

---

## 2. `logits[:, -1, :]`

* `:` → 保留所有 batch。
* `-1` → 取序列的最后一个时间步（下标 -1 表示最后一个位置）。
* `:` → 保留 vocab 维度。

所以形状从 `(B, T, vocab_size)` 变成：

```
(B, vocab_size)
```

---

## 3. 为什么只取最后一个位置？

因为 **自回归语言模型** 是逐步生成的：

* 给定序列前 `T` 个 token，要预测第 `T+1` 个 token。
* 所以我们只关心 **最后一个 token 的预测分布**。
* 前面的预测（对位置 1…T-1 的 logits）在这一轮生成里用不到。

---

## 4. 举个例子

假设：

* batch size B=2
* 当前序列长度 T=3
* 词表大小 vocab\_size=5

那么 `model(x)` 输出：

```
logits.shape = (2, 3, 5)
```

意思是：

* 对 batch=2 个样本
* 每个序列有 3 个位置
* 每个位置有 5 个词的预测分布

取最后一个位置：

```
logits = logits[:, -1, :]  
logits.shape = (2, 5)
```

现在只剩下最后一个位置的预测分布（每个样本一个长度=5 的向量）。

---

✅ **总结**
`logits[:, -1, :]` 的作用是：

* 从模型的输出 `(B, T, vocab_size)` 中
* 只取出 **最后一个 token 的预测分布**
* 得到 `(B, vocab_size)`，方便后续做 softmax → 采样下一个 token。

---

要不要我再帮你解释一下 **如果不取 `-1`，而直接用 `(B,T,vocab_size)` 的 logits 会发生什么？**


好 👍 我来用一个小例子解释清楚 **`torch.multinomial` + `torch.gather`** 这两步是怎么把概率采样变成真正的 token id 的。

---

## 代码片段

```python
ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1)      # (B, 1)
xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix)  # (B, 1)
```

---

## 1. 场景设定

假设 batch size $B=2$，词表大小 6，我们做了 top-k (k=3)。

此时：

```python
topk_probs = tensor([
    [0.5, 0.3, 0.2],   # batch 1 的 top-3 概率
    [0.6, 0.25, 0.15]  # batch 2 的 top-3 概率
])  # shape (2, 3)

topk_indices = tensor([
    [10, 20, 30],   # batch 1 的 top-3 词表索引
    [40, 50, 60]    # batch 2 的 top-3 词表索引
])  # shape (2, 3)
```

这里 `topk_indices` 里的数字是 **真实词表中的 token id**。

---

## 2. `torch.multinomial`

```python
ix = torch.multinomial(topk_probs, 1)
```

* 按概率采样一个索引（范围是 0\~2，对应 top-k 里的第几个）。
* 假设结果是：

```python
ix = tensor([
    [0],   # batch 1 采样到 top-1（id=10）
    [2]    # batch 2 采样到 top-3（id=60）
])  # shape (2,1)
```

---

## 3. `torch.gather`

```python
xcol = torch.gather(topk_indices, -1, ix)
```

* 在 `topk_indices` 里，根据 `ix` 把真正的 token id 取出来。
* 结果：

```python
xcol = tensor([
    [10],   # 从 [10,20,30] 里取下标 0 → 10
    [60]    # 从 [40,50,60] 里取下标 2 → 60
])  # shape (2,1)
```

---

## 4. 总结流程

* `multinomial` → 在 top-k 的概率分布里，采样一个“位置索引”。
* `gather` → 用这个位置索引，到 `topk_indices` 里找到真正的 token id。

最终我们得到了要生成的新 token id `(B,1)`，可以拼接到序列后面。

---

✅ **一句话总结**
`multinomial` 决定“选第几个候选词”，`gather` 决定“这个候选词在词表里的真实 id”。

---

要不要我帮你把这个过程画成一个 **采样示意表**（topk\_probs → multinomial → topk\_indices → gather）？

好 👍 我来解释这一行：

```python
tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()
```

---

## 1. 背景

此时 `x` 是生成好的 token 序列，shape 大概是：

```
x.shape = (B, T_generated)
```

* `B` = batch size（比如 5，表示生成 5 个不同序列）
* `T_generated` = 实际生成的长度（可能大于等于 `max_length`）

---

## 2. `x[i, :max_length]`

* `x[i]` → 取第 `i` 个样本的序列，shape = `(T_generated,)`
* `:max_length` → 只保留前 `max_length` 个 token，避免超长
* 结果是一个 **一维张量**，长度 = `max_length`

例如：

```python
x[i, :max_length] = tensor([15496, 11, 314, 257, 5766, 1158, 11, ...])
```

---

## 3. `.tolist()`

* 把 PyTorch 张量转换成 **Python list**。
* 因为后面要用 `enc.decode(tokens)`，而 `decode` 接收的是 Python list（token id 列表），不是 PyTorch 张量。

---

## 4. 举个例子

假设：

```python
x = torch.tensor([
    [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
])  # shape (2, 5)

max_length = 3
i = 1

tokens = x[i, :max_length].tolist()
print(tokens)  # [60, 70, 80]
```

---

## ✅ 总结

这一行的作用是：

1. 从生成好的 batch 结果 `x` 里取出第 `i` 个样本；
2. 截断到 `max_length` 个 token；
3. 转成 Python list，方便后续解码成字符串。

---

要不要我再帮你解释一下 **为什么最后一步需要用 `enc.decode(tokens)` 才能变回文字**？



# sampling loop

here um so what's happening here in this code block is we have this x which is of
size B BYT right so batch by time and we're going to be in every iteration of
this loop we're going to be adding a column of new indices into each one of these rows right and so these are the
new indices and we're appending them to the the sequence as we're sampling so with each Loop iteration we get one more
column into X and all of the operations happen in the context manager of torch. nograd this is just telling pytorch that
we're not going to be calling that backward on any of this so it doesn't have to cach all the intermediate tensors it's not going to have to
prepare in any way for a potential backward later and this saves a lot of space and also possibly uh some time so
we get our low jits we get the loow jits at only the last location we throw away all the other low jits uh we don't need
them we only care about the last columns low jits so this is being wasteful uh
but uh this is just kind of like an inefficient implementation of sampling um so it's correct but
inefficient so we get the last column of loow jits pass it through soft Max to get our probabilities then here I'm
doing top case sampling of 50 and I'm doing that because this is the hugging face default so just looking at the
hugging face docks here of a pipeline um there's a bunch of
quarks that go into hugging face and I mean it's it's kind of a lot honestly
but I guess the important one that I noticed is that they're using top K by default which is 50 and what that does
is that uh so that's being used here as well and what that does is basically we want to take our probabilities and we
only want to keep the top 50 probabilities and anything that is lower than the 50th probability uh we just
clamp to zero and renormalize and so that way we are never sampling very rare
tokens uh the tokens we're going to be sampling are always in the top 50 of most likely tokens and this helps keep
the model kind of on track and it doesn't blabber on and it doesn't get lost and doesn't go off the rails as easily uh and it kind of like um sticks
in the vicinity of likely tokens a lot better so this is the way to do it in pytorch and you can step through it if
you like I don't think it's super insightful so I'll speed through it but roughly speaking we get this new column
of of tokens we append them on x and basically The Columns of X grow until
this y Loop gets tripped up and then finally we have an entire X of size um 5
by 30 in this case in this example and we can just basically print all those
individual rows so I'm getting all the rows I'm getting all the tokens that were sampled and I'm using the decode
function from Tik tokenizer to get back the string which we can print and so
terminal new terminal and let me python train
gpt2 okay so these are the generations that we're getting hello I'm a language model not a
program um new line new line Etc hello I'm a language model and one of the main
things that bothers me when they create languages is how easy it becomes to create something that I me so this will
just like blabber on right in all these cases now one thing you will notice is that these Generations are not the
generations of hugging face here and I can't find the discrepancy to be honest
and I didn't fully go through all these options but probably there's something else hiding in on addition to the top P
so I'm not able to match it up but just for correctness um down here Below in the juper notebook and using the hugging
face model so this is the hugging face model here I was I replicated the code
and if I do this and I run that then I am getting the same results so basically
the model internals are not wrong it's just I'm not 100% sure what the pipeline does in hugging face and that's why
we're not able to match them up but otherwise the code is correct and we've loaded all the um tensors correctly so
we're initializing the model correctly and everything here works so long story short uh We've Port it all the weights
we initialize the gpt2 this is the exact opening gpt2 and it can generate
sequences and they look sensible and now here of course we're initializing with gbt2 model weights but now we want to
initialize from scratch from random numbers and we want to actually train a model that will give us sequences as
good as or better than these ones in quality and so that's what we turn to
next so it turns out that using the random model is actually fairly straightforward because pytorch already

当然，以下是这段内容的中文解释：

## 采样循环（Sampling Loop）

这段代码的作用是进行文本生成的采样。我们通过一个循环不断生成下一个 token，并将其加入到当前序列中，直到达到指定的生成长度。

### 1. 处理输入和生成新 token

* **输入**：我们从初始输入 `X` 开始，`X` 的形状是 `[B, T]`，即每个批次 `B` 有一个最大长度为 `T` 的序列。在每次迭代中，我们会向每行序列的末尾添加一个新 token，这个 token 是模型预测的下一个 token。
* **操作**：在每一轮循环中，我们只关注当前预测的最后一个 token 的 logits（概率值）。通过这些 logits，我们能够预测下一个最可能的 token。
* **注意**：虽然每次我们都会计算出整个序列的 logits，但这里只关心最后一列的 logits，所以其余的 logits 会被丢弃掉。这种做法是低效的，但为了代码简洁和验证功能，它是正确的。

### 2. 获取 logits 并进行采样

* 我们使用 **softmax** 函数将 logits 转换为概率分布。
* 然后，使用 **top-k 采样** 来选择最有可能的 k 个 token。默认情况下，`k=50`，这意味着我们只保留概率排名前 50 的 token，其他的概率设置为 0，再重新归一化概率。这种做法有助于避免采样到概率极低的 token，使生成的文本更加连贯和合理。

### 3. 循环生成文本

* 每次生成一个新的 token，并将它追加到当前的序列 `X` 中，更新输入，继续预测下一个 token。
* 这样，随着每次循环的进行，`X` 的列数会增加，直到达到预定的生成长度（例如 30）。

### 4. 打印生成的文本

* 最后，我们打印出所有生成的文本序列。通过调用 `Tik tokenizer` 的解码功能，将生成的 token 列表转换回人类可读的文本。
* 你会看到一些生成的句子（例如：**"Hello, I'm a language model, not a program"**），它们是基于给定的前缀（"Hello, I'm a language model"）生成的。

### 5. 问题和结果不一致

* 需要注意的是，生成的文本与 Hugging Face 默认模型的生成结果略有不同。原因可能在于 Hugging Face 模型的 **pipeline** 中使用了一些额外的参数（如 top-p 采样等）。尽管如此，模型内部的运作是正确的，生成的文本结构和逻辑是合理的。
* 为了确保我们的方法是正确的，我也在 Jupyter Notebook 中验证了 Hugging Face 的代码，结果是相同的。

### 6. 从头开始训练模型

* 尽管我们已经成功加载了 GPT-2 的预训练权重并能生成合理的文本，接下来我们想要做的是：**从随机初始化的模型开始训练**，通过训练生成与 Hugging Face 相似或更优质的文本。
* 这种从随机初始化训练模型的方法其实非常简单，因为 **PyTorch 已经为我们提供了很多工具**，可以轻松实现这一过程。

---

总结来说，这段代码实现了通过 **top-k 采样** 生成文本的过程，通过每轮循环添加一个新 token，并利用 softmax 得到概率分布，最终生成连贯的文本。尽管和 Hugging Face 的生成结果存在小差异，但整体上，我们成功地从 GPT-2 权重初始化模型，并能生成合理的文本序列。

如果你想了解如何调整采样参数，或者如何从头开始训练模型，随时告诉我！

# model.to('cuda')
model.to('cpu')

# x = tokens.to('cuda')
x = tokens.to('cpu')

torch.manual_seed(42)
# torch.cuda.manual_seed(42)

# sample, auto-detect the device

initializes our model randomly and by default so when we create the GPT model
and the Constructor this is all um all of these layers and modules have random
initializers that are there by default so when these linear layers get created and so on there's default Constructors
for example using the Javier initialization that we saw in the past uh to construct the weights of these
layers and so creating a random model instead of a gpt2 model is actually
fairly straightforward and we would just come here and instead we would create model equals GPT and then we want to use
the default config GPT config and the default config uses the 124 M parameters
so this is the random model initialization and we can run
it and we should be able to get uh results now the results here of course
are total garbage carbal and that's because this is random model and so we're just getting all these random token string pieces chunked up totally
at random so that's what we have right now uh now one more thing I wanted to point out by the way is in case you do
not have Cuda available because you don't have a GPU you can still follow along with uh with what we're doing here
uh to some extent uh and probably not to the very end because by the end we're going to be using multiple gpus and
actually doing a serious training run uh but for now you can actually follow along decently okay uh so one thing that
I like to do in pytorch is I like to autod detect the device that is available to you so in particular you
could do that like this so here we are trying to detect a device
to run on that has the highest compute capability you can think about it that way so by default we start with CPU
which of course is available everywhere because every single computer will have a CPU but then we can try to detect do
you have a GPU you so use a Cuda and then if you don't have a Cuda uh do you
at least have MPS MPS is the back end for Apple silicon so if you have a Macbook that is fairly new you probably
have apple silicon on the inside and then that has a GPU that is actually fairly capable uh depending on which
MacBook you have and so you can use MPS which will be potentially faster than CPU and so we can print the device here
now once we have the device we can actually use it in place of Puda so we
just swap it in and notice that here when we call model on X if this x here
is on CPU instead of GPU then it will work fine because here in the forward
which is where P to will come when we create a pose we were careful to use the
device of idx to create this tensor as well and so there won't be any mismatch
where one tensor is on CPU one is on GPU and uh that you can't combine those but here we are um carefully initializing on
the correct device as indicated by the input to this model so this will autod
detect device for me this will be of course GPU so using device
Cuda uh but uh you can also run with um as I mentioned another device and it's
not going to be too much slower so if I override device here oops if I override device equals
CPU then we'll still print Cuda of course but now we're actually using CPU one 2 3
4 5 6 okay about 6 seconds and actually
we're not using torch compile and stuff like that which will speed up everything a lot faster as well but you can follow
even on a CPU I think to a decent extent um so that's note on that okay so I do
want to loop around eventually into what it means to have different devices in pytorch and what it is exactly that
pytorch does in the background for you when you do something like module. 2 device or where you take a torch tensor
and do A2 device and what exactly happens and how that works but for now I'd like to get to training and I'd like

## 采样与自动检测设备

### 1. 随机初始化模型

当我们初始化模型时，默认情况下，所有的层和模块都使用随机初始化。举个例子，当创建线性层时，会使用 **Xavier 初始化**（一种常见的权重初始化方法）来构造这些层的权重。因此，**从随机初始化开始训练模型**是非常简单的，只需要调用：

```python
model = GPT(config)
```

这里的 `config` 是默认的配置，它会创建一个 124M 参数的模型。这样初始化后的模型将随机生成权重，所以生成的结果将毫无意义。例如，生成的文本会是一些随机的 token 字符串，完全没有实际的意义。

### 2. 自动检测设备

接下来，代码会自动检测你计算机上可用的设备，并将模型和数据转移到该设备上进行计算。**PyTorch 提供了设备自动检测功能**，它会根据设备的计算能力来选择合适的计算资源。

具体步骤如下：

1. 默认情况下，模型会首先尝试在 **CPU** 上运行，因为每台计算机都会有 CPU。
2. 然后，代码会检查是否有 **CUDA** 可用，如果有 GPU，则会将模型迁移到 GPU 上。
3. 如果没有 CUDA 可用，代码会检查是否有 **MPS**（即 Apple Silicon 的后端）。对于使用 **Apple Silicon**（如 M1 或 M2 芯片的 MacBook）的用户，MPS 可以作为 GPU 进行计算，通常会比 CPU 快。

### 3. 切换到设备上运行

无论是 CPU 还是 GPU，代码会确保输入数据（如 `X`）和模型在同一个设备上，避免因为设备不匹配导致的错误。例如，下面的代码可以自动根据硬件配置选择设备：

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```

这行代码会根据设备的可用性，自动选择 **CUDA**、**MPS** 或 **CPU**，然后将模型转移到该设备上。

### 4. 在不同设备上运行

* 如果设备是 **GPU**（CUDA），模型会利用 GPU 进行计算，这样能大大加速训练。
* 如果没有 GPU 可用，模型会自动使用 **CPU**，虽然速度会慢一些，但仍然可以继续运行。

例如，如果你强制将设备设置为 **CPU**，那么模型仍然可以在 CPU 上运行，只是速度会变慢。通过这种方式，即使没有 GPU，仍然可以进行模型训练和生成。

### 5. 设备转换细节

PyTorch 会自动管理设备之间的数据转换。当你将模型或张量从一个设备（如 CPU）转移到另一个设备（如 GPU）时，PyTorch 会在后台处理这些转换，确保不会发生设备不匹配的错误。

---

总的来说，这段代码的目的是确保无论你使用 CPU 还是 GPU，模型和数据都能够正确地放置在适当的计算设备上，从而提高计算效率并保证代码的兼容性。

如果你有更多关于设备管理或训练细节的问题，可以随时告诉我！


# let’s train: data batches (B,T) → logits (B,T,C)

to start training the model and for now let's just say the device makes code go fast um and let's go into how we can
actually train the model so to train the model we're going to need some data set and for me the best debugging simplest
data set that I like to use is the tiny Shakespeare data set um and it's available at this URL so you can W get
it or you can just search tiny Shakespeare data set and so um I have in my file system
as just LS input.txt so I already downloaded it and here I'm
reading the data set getting the first 1,000 characters and printing the first 100
now remember that gpt2 has uh roughly a compression ratio the tokenizer has a
compression ratio of rly 3 to1 so th000 characters is roughly 300 tokens here uh
that will come out of this in the slice that we're currently getting so this is the first few uh
characters and uh if you want to get a few more statistics on this we can do work count on input.txt
so we can see that this is uh 40,000 lines about 200,000 words in this data
set and about 1 million bytes in this file and knowing that this file is only
asky characters there's no crazy unic code here as far as I know and so every asky character is encoded with one bite
and so this is uh the same number roughly a million characters inside this data set so that's the data set size uh
by default very small and minimal data set for debugging to get us off the ground in order to tokenize this data
set we're going to get Tik token encoding for gbt2 encode the data uh the
first um 1,000 characters and then I'm only going to print the first 24 tokens
so these are the tokens as a list of integers and if you can read gpt2 tokens
you will see that 198 here you'll recognize that as the slashing character so that is a new line and then here for
example we have two new lines so that's 198 twice here uh so this is just a tokenization of the first 24 tokens so
what we want to do now is we want to actually process these token sequences and feed them into a Transformer and in
particular we want them we want to rearrange these tokens into this idx
variable that we're going to be feeding into the Transformer so we don't want a single very long onedimensional sequence
we want an entire batch where each sequence is up to uh is basically T
tokens and T cannot be larger than the maximum sequence length and then we have these t uh tlong uh sequences of tokens
and we have B independent examples of sequences so how can we create a b BYT
tensor that we can feed into the forward out of these onedimensional sequences so here's my favorite way to
to achieve this uh so if we take torch and then we create a tensor object out of this list of integers and just the
first 24 tokens my favorite way to do this is basically you do a do view of um
of uh for example 4x6 which multiply to 24 and so it's just a two-dimensional
rearrangement of these tokens and you'll is that when you view this onedimensional sequence as two-dimensional 4x6 here the first six
uh tokens uh up to here end up being the first row the next six tokens here end
up being the second row and so on and so basically it's just going to stack up this the um every six tokens in this
case as independent rows and it creates a batch of tokens in this case and so for example if we are token 25 in the
Transformer when we feed this in and this becomes the idx this token is going to see these three tokens and it's going
to try to predict that 198 comes next so in this way we are able to
create this two-dimensional batch that's that's quite nice now in terms of the label that we're going to need for the
Target to calculate the loss function how do we get that well we could write some code inside the forward pass
because we know that the next uh token in a sequence which is the label is just to the right of us but you'll notice
that actually we for this token at the very end 13 we don't actually have the next correct token because we didn't
load it so uh we actually didn't get enough information here so I'll show you
my favorite way of basically getting these batches and I like to personally have not just the input to the
Transformer which I like to call X but I also like to create the labels uh tensor
which is of the exact same size as X but contains the targets at every single position
and so here's the way that I like to do that I like to make sure that I fetch plus one uh token because we need the
ground Truth for the very last token uh for 13 and then when we're creating the
input we take everything up to the last token not including and view it as 4x6
and when we're creating targets we do the buffer but starting at index one not
index zero so we're skipping the first element and we view it in the exact same size and then when I print this
here's what happens where we see that basically as an example for this token 25 its Target was 198 and that's now
just stored at the exact same position in the Target tensor which is 198 and also this last token 13 now has its
label which is 198 and that's just because we loaded this plus one here so
basically this is the way I like to do it you take long sequences you uh view them in two- dimensional terms so that
you get batch of time and then we make sure to load one additional token so we
basically load a buffer of tokens of B * t+ one and then we sort of offset things
and view them and then we have two tensors one of them is the input to the Transformer and the other exactly is the
labels and so let's now reorganize this code and um create a very simple data
loader object that tries to basically load these tokens and um feed them to the Transformer and calculate the loss
okay so I reshuffled the code here uh accordingly so as you can see here I'm temporarily overwriting U to run a CPU
and importing TI token and all of this should look familiar we're loading a th000 characters I'm setting BT to just
be 4 and 32 right now just because we're debugging we just want to have a single batch that's very small and all of this
should now look familiar and follows what we did on the right and then here we get the we create the model and get
the lits and so so here as you see I already ran this only runs in a few
seconds but because we have a batch of uh 4X 32 our lits are now of size 4X 32x
50257 so those are the lit for what comes next at every position and now we
have the labels which are stored in y so now is the time to calculate the loss and then do the backward pass and then
the optimization so let's first calculate the loss okay so to calculate the loss we're

## 训练模型：数据批次（B,T） → logits（B,T,C）

### 1. 准备训练数据

为了训练模型，我们首先需要一个数据集。这里选择了一个非常简单的小数据集——**Tiny Shakespeare 数据集**，它包含了莎士比亚的作品，非常适合用来进行调试和测试。你可以从以下链接获取这个数据集，或者在搜索引擎中查找“Tiny Shakespeare 数据集”。

* 数据集大小：约 40,000 行，约 200,000 个单词，文件大约 1MB。
* 数据集中的每个字符都是 ASCII 字符（占用 1 个字节）。

我们将文件加载到内存中，并从中读取前 1,000 个字符。根据 GPT-2 的 **tokenizer（分词器）**，这些字符会被转化为 token，大约会得到 300 个 token。

### 2. 分词和编码

我们使用 **tiktoken** 库来对文本进行编码，将文本转化为 GPT-2 可以处理的 token。每个 token 对应一个整数，下面的代码展示了如何将前 1,000 个字符编码成 token。

```python
tokens = tokenizer.encode(input_data[:1000])
print(tokens[:24])
```

输出的 **tokens** 是一个整数列表，每个整数对应一个 token。例如，`198` 对应的是换行符 `\n`，而连续两个 `198` 就表示两个换行符。

### 3. 创建批次数据（B,T）

为了将数据输入到 Transformer 中，我们需要将这些 token 转换为批次数据。每个批次（batch）包含多个序列，每个序列的长度最多为 `T`。为了创建这个批次数据，我们需要将这些长的 token 序列重排为一个二维的张量。

举个例子，如果我们有一个 1 维的 token 列表（例如长度为 24），我们可以将其重排为一个形状为 `[4, 6]` 的二维张量（4 行 6 列）。这样就得到了一批次包含 4 个序列，每个序列长度为 6 的数据。

```python
batch = torch.tensor(tokens[:24]).view(4, 6)
```

这样，`batch` 的内容就变成了一个二维张量，其中每一行就是一个独立的序列，长度为 6。

### 4. 创建标签（Labels）

模型训练时，我们需要计算 **损失函数（loss）**，而损失函数的计算需要有标签。标签是每个 token 后面紧跟的那个 token，也就是预测目标。

例如，在输入序列 `X = [1, 2, 3]` 中，目标（标签）应该是 `[2, 3, 4]`。但是对于序列的最后一个 token，我们没有后续的 token，所以需要确保为最后一个 token 创建一个正确的标签。为此，我们将标签序列向右偏移一个位置，并填充最后一个位置的标签。

```python
X = batch
y = batch.roll(-1, dims=1)
y[:, -1] = 198  # 最后一个位置的标签（假设为换行符）
```

### 5. 计算损失并进行反向传播

现在我们已经有了 **输入数据（X）** 和 **标签（y）**，接下来可以计算 **logits**（预测的未归一化概率），并根据 **logits 和标签** 计算 **损失**。

损失计算完成后，就可以进行 **反向传播（backward pass）** 和 **优化（optimization）**，更新模型的权重。

---

### 总结

* 我们首先加载并分词数据，然后将其转化为批次数据。
* 每个批次的数据形状是 `[B, T]`，其中 `B` 是批次大小，`T` 是序列的长度。
* 对于每个 token，我们生成对应的标签，并根据模型的预测计算损失。
* 最后，我们使用 **反向传播** 更新模型的权重。

这样，我们就可以开始训练模型了。

---

如果你想了解如何实现具体的损失计算、优化步骤，或者如何进一步优化训练过程，请随时告诉我！

```
# get a data batch
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
text = text[:1000]
tokens = enc.encode(text)
B, T = 4, 32
buf = torch.tensor(tokens[:B*T + 1])
x = buf[:-1].view(B, T)
y = buf[1:].view(B, T)
```

啊，我明白啦 🙂 你是问这里的 **冒号 `:`**：

```python
buf = torch.tensor(tokens[:B*T + 1])
```

---

## 1. Python 切片语法

在 Python 里，冒号 `:` 是 **切片运算符 (slice)**。
语法一般是：

```python
list[start:end:step]
```

* `start`：开始位置（包含），默认是 0
* `end`：结束位置（不包含）
* `step`：步长，默认是 1

---

## 2. 在你这行代码里

```python
tokens[:B*T + 1]
```

意思是：

* 从头开始 (`start` 省略 = 0)
* 取到 **第 `B*T+1` 个元素之前**（不包含）
* 步长默认为 1

所以它相当于：

```python
tokens[0 : B*T+1 : 1]
```

---

## 3. 举个例子

```python
tokens = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

B, T = 2, 4
tokens[:B*T + 1]  # = tokens[:9]
```

结果是：

```python
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

取了前 9 个元素。

---

## ✅ 总结

* `:` 是 **切片符号**。
* `tokens[:B*T + 1]` 表示 **从头开始，取前 `B*T+1` 个元素**。

---

要不要我顺便把 Python 切片里一些常见用法（比如 `[::-1]`、`[2:]`、`[:-2]`）也给你总结一下？

# cross entropy loss

going to adjust the forward function of this NN module in the model and in particular we're not just going to be
returning logits but also we're going to return the loss uh and we're going to not just pass in the input in thees but
also the targets uh in y and now we will
print not Lo just. shape anymore we're actually going to print the loss function and then c. exit of zero so
that we skip some of the sampling logic so now let's swing up to the forward function which gets called there because
now we also have these optional targets and when we get the targets we
can also calculate uh the loss and remember that we want to basically return uh log just loss and loss by
default is none but um let's put this here if uh targets is
not none then we want to calculate loss and co-pilot is already getting excited
here and calculating the what looks to be correct loss it is using the cross entropy loss as is documented here uh so
this is a function in pytorch under the functional now what is actually
happening here because it looks a little bit scary uh basically uh the F that cross entropy does not like
multi-dimensional inputs it can't take a b BYT by vocap size so what's happening here is that we are flattening out this
three-dimensional tensor into just two Dimensions the First Dimension is going to be calculated automatically and it's
going to be B * T and then the last Dimension is vocap size so basically
this is uh flattening out this three-dimensional tensor of logits to just be two- dimensional B * T all
individual examples and vocap size on uh in terms of the length of each row and
then it's also flattening out the targets which are also two- dimensional at this stage but we're going to just
flatten them out so they're just a single tensor of B * T and this can then pass into cross entropy to calculate a
loss which we return so this should basically at this point run because this
is not too complicated so let's run it and let's see if we
should be printing the
loss and here we see that we printed 11 uh roughly and so
um and notice that this is the tensor of a single element which is this number 11
now we also want to be able to calculate a reasonable uh kind of starting point for a random rationalized Network so we
covered this in previous videos but our vocabulary size is 50257 at initialization of the network
you would hope that um every vocab element is getting roughly a uniform
probability uh so that we're not favoring at initialization any token way too much we're not confidently wrong at
initialization so what we're hoping is that the probability of any arbitrary token is roughly 1 over 50,2 57 and now
we can sanity check the loss because remember that the cross entropy loss is just basically the negative um log
likelihood so if we now take this probability and we take it through the natural logarithm and then we do the
negative that is the loss we expect at initialization and we covered this in previous videos so I would expect
something around 10.82 and we're seeing something around 11 so it's not way off this is roughly the probability I expect
at initialization so that tells me that the at initialization or probability distribtion is roughly diffused it's a
good starting point and we can now uh perform the optimization and tell the network which elements you know should
follow correctly in what order so at this point we can do a l step backward calculate the gradients and do an
optimization so let's get to that okay so let's do the optimization now um so

## 交叉熵损失（Cross Entropy Loss）

### 1. 修改前向传播函数

为了训练模型，我们需要计算损失。在这段代码中，我们对模型的 **前向传播（forward）** 函数进行了调整。除了返回 logits 之外，我们还需要计算并返回 **损失**，并且输入不仅包含数据，还包括 **目标（targets）**。

修改后的 `forward` 函数如下：

* 如果传入的 **目标**（targets）不为空，我们将计算损失。
* 计算损失时，使用 **PyTorch** 中的 **交叉熵损失（cross entropy loss）** 函数。

### 2. 交叉熵损失的计算

在计算交叉熵损失时，我们首先需要理解 PyTorch 的 `cross_entropy` 函数的一些要求：

* 交叉熵损失函数不能处理多维输入，它需要输入为二维张量，其中：

  * 第一个维度是 **B\*T**，即批次大小和序列长度的乘积；
  * 第二个维度是 **vocab\_size**，即词汇表的大小。

因此，我们需要将 **logits** 和 **targets** 这两个三维张量展平（flatten）为二维张量：

* `logits` 的形状会被展平为 `[B*T, vocab_size]`，每行代表一个样本的预测；
* `targets` 也会被展平为 `[B*T]`，即每个样本对应的真实标签。

这样，我们就可以将它们传入 `cross_entropy` 函数来计算损失。

### 3. 计算损失

通过 `cross_entropy` 函数计算损失后，我们得到的损失值应该是一个标量。然后，打印出损失值，结果接近 **11**。这个损失值说明了模型当前的表现。

### 4. 检查初始化时的损失

我们希望在模型初始化时，**每个 token 的预测概率是均匀的**。具体来说，我们希望在初始化时，模型对每个 token 的概率大约是 `1 / vocab_size`（即约 1 / 50257）。这是因为在初始化时，模型不应该偏向任何特定的 token，而是应该有一个合理的分布，避免过度自信的错误。

### 5. 损失的期望值

交叉熵损失本质上是负对数似然（negative log-likelihood）。因此，在初始化时，如果概率均匀分布，我们的期望损失值可以通过以下方式计算：

* 取 `1 / vocab_size`，然后对其取自然对数（`log`），再取负值。
* 这个计算结果应该接近 **10.82**，而实际输出是 **11**，这个结果是合理的，表明初始化时的概率分布是均匀的。

### 6. 启动优化过程

现在，我们知道模型的初始化是合理的，概率分布大致均匀。接下来，我们可以开始 **优化（optimization）**：

* 我们进行 **反向传播（backward）**，计算梯度；
* 然后，我们执行 **优化步骤**，更新模型的参数，使其在训练过程中逐渐提高性能。

---

### 总结

* 我们修改了 `forward` 函数，使其不仅返回 logits，还能返回损失（cross-entropy loss）。
* 通过交叉熵损失，我们可以计算模型的预测与真实标签之间的差距。
* 在初始化时，损失值大致为 **11**，这与我们期望的值 **10.82** 非常接近，说明模型的初始化是合理的。
* 现在，我们可以开始进行优化步骤，通过反向传播和梯度更新，训练模型。

---

如果你需要更详细的优化步骤或损失函数的理解，随时告诉我！

```
targets.view(-1)
```

好 👌 我来解释 **`targets.view(-1)`**。

---

## 1. 背景

在语言模型训练里，我们有：

* **logits** → 预测结果，形状是 `(B, T, vocab_size)`
* **targets** → 真实标签，形状是 `(B, T)`

交叉熵 `F.cross_entropy` 需要的输入是：

* 预测：`(N, C)`，其中 `N` = 样本数，`C` = 类别数
* 标签：`(N,)`，每个元素是类别 id

所以要把 `(B, T)` 的 `targets` 拉平成一维 `(B*T,)`。

---

## 2. `.view(-1)` 的作用

```python
targets.view(-1)
```

* `view`：改变张量的形状（不复制内存）。
* `-1`：让 PyTorch **自动推算**这一维的长度。

如果 `targets.shape = (B, T)`，
那么 `targets.view(-1)` → `(B*T,)`。

---

## 3. 举个例子

```python
import torch

targets = torch.tensor([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])  # shape (2,3)

print(targets.view(-1))  # -> shape (6,)
# tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

把二维 `(2,3)` 展平成一维 `(6,)`。

---

## 4. 在你的代码里的意义

```python
loss = F.cross_entropy(
    logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)),  # (B*T, vocab_size)
    targets.view(-1)                   # (B*T,)
)
```

这样 logits 和 targets 对齐：

* logits 的每一行 → 预测某个位置的词概率分布
* targets 的每个元素 → 该位置的真实词 id

---

✅ **总结**

* `targets.view(-1)` 就是把 `(B,T)` 的标签拉平成 `(B*T,)`，方便和展平后的 logits 对齐计算交叉熵损失。

---

要不要我顺便再帮你讲一下 `reshape` 和 `view` 的区别？

```
# optimize!
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
for i in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    logits, loss = model(x, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"step {i}, loss: {loss.item()}")
```

好 👍 这一段就是一个最小化语言模型的 **训练循环**。我逐行解释：

---

## 1. 定义优化器

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
```

* 使用 **AdamW 优化器**（Adam + 权重衰减，Transformer 里常用）。
* `model.parameters()` → 把模型的所有可训练参数交给优化器管理。
* `lr=3e-4` → 学习率 0.0003。

---

## 2. 训练循环

```python
for i in range(50):
```

* 循环 50 个训练 step（不是完整 epoch，只是演示）。

---

## 3. 梯度清零

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

* PyTorch 的梯度是 **累加的**，如果不清零，每次 `loss.backward()` 的梯度会累加到之前的。
* 所以每个 step 训练前要先把梯度清零。

---

## 4. 前向传播

```python
logits, loss = model(x, y)
```

* 输入 `x`（输入序列）、`y`（目标序列）。
* `model` 返回：

  * `logits` → 预测值 `(B, T, vocab_size)`
  * `loss` → 根据 `x` 和 `y` 算出来的交叉熵损失。

---

## 5. 反向传播

```python
loss.backward()
```

* PyTorch 会根据 `loss` 计算所有参数的梯度，存到 `param.grad`。
* 这是自动微分 (autograd) 的核心。

---

## 6. 更新参数

```python
optimizer.step()
```

* 用优化器（AdamW）更新模型参数：

  $$
  \theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \text{AdamW}(\nabla_\theta L)
  $$
* 也就是执行一次梯度下降。

---

## 7. 打印训练过程

```python
print(f"step {i}, loss: {loss.item()}")
```

* `.item()` 把 PyTorch 张量（标量）转成 Python float。
* 打印当前 step 的 loss，方便观察收敛情况。

---

## ✅ 总结

这一段代码是 **训练一个 GPT 语言模型的最小 demo**：

1. 定义优化器 `AdamW`。
2. 循环训练：

   * 清零梯度
   * 前向传播算 loss
   * 反向传播算梯度
   * 参数更新
3. 打印 loss 追踪训练效果。

---

👉 如果继续扩展，它就能变成完整的 **miniGPT 训练器**。

要不要我帮你画一个 **训练循环流程图**（数据 → 前向传播 → loss → backward → optimizer → 更新参数 → 下一步）？

```
import tiktoken

class DataLoaderLite:
    def __init__(self, B, T):
        self.B = B
        self.T = T

        # at init load tokens from disk and store them in memory
        with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
            text = f.read()
        enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
        tokens = enc.encode(text)
        self.tokens = torch.tensor(tokens)
        print(f"loaded {len(self.tokens)} tokens")
        print(f"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens) // (B * T)} batches")

        # state
        self.current_position = 0

    def next_batch(self):
        B, T = self.B, self.T
        buf = self.tokens[self.current_position : self.current_position+B*T+1]
        x = (buf[:-1]).view(B, T) # inputs
        y = (buf[1:]).view(B, T) # targets
        # advance the position in the tensor
        self.current_position += B * T
        # if loading the next batch would be out of bounds, reset
        if self.current_position + (B * T + 1) > len(self.tokens):
            self.current_position = 0
        return x, y
```

好 👌 这段代码实现了一个非常简化版的 **数据加载器 (DataLoaderLite)**，用来给 GPT 训练提供小批次 `(x, y)` 数据。我们逐块看：

---

## 1. 类定义与初始化

```python
class DataLoaderLite:
    def __init__(self, B, T):
        self.B = B
        self.T = T
```

* `B` = batch size
* `T` = 序列长度
* 初始化时把它们保存下来，后面生成 batch 时用。

---

## 2. 加载文本并编码成 tokens

```python
with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding('gpt2')
tokens = enc.encode(text)
self.tokens = torch.tensor(tokens)
```

* 从磁盘读取 `input.txt` 的内容。
* 用 GPT-2 的分词器 (`tiktoken`) 把文本转成 **token id 列表**。
* 转成 PyTorch `tensor`，方便后续切片操作。

```python
print(f"loaded {len(self.tokens)} tokens")
print(f"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens) // (B * T)} batches")
```

* 打印总 token 数。
* 一个 epoch 能生成多少个 batch（取整除）。

---

## 3. 状态指针

```python
self.current_position = 0
```

* 维护一个 **当前位置指针**，表示下一次取 batch 时从哪里开始。

---

## 4. 获取一个 batch

```python
def next_batch(self):
    B, T = self.B, self.T
    buf = self.tokens[self.current_position : self.current_position+B*T+1]
```

* 从当前指针位置切 `B*T+1` 个 token 出来。

  * 为什么 `+1`？因为要构造 `(x, y)`，需要错开一位。

---

## 5. 构造输入和目标

```python
x = (buf[:-1]).view(B, T) # inputs
y = (buf[1:]).view(B, T)  # targets
```

* `buf[:-1]` → 前 `B*T` 个 token，reshape 成 `(B, T)`，作为输入序列。
* `buf[1:]` → 后 `B*T` 个 token，reshape 成 `(B, T)`，作为目标序列。
* 效果：模型学习 **预测下一个 token**。

例如：

```
buf = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
x   = [5, 6, 7, 8]
y   = [6, 7, 8, 9]
```

---

## 6. 更新位置

```python
self.current_position += B * T
if self.current_position + (B * T + 1) > len(self.tokens):
    self.current_position = 0
```

* 每次取完一个 batch，就把指针往前移动 `B*T` 个 token。
* 如果剩下的 token 不够一个 batch，就重置到 0，从头开始。
* 这相当于一轮 epoch。

---

## 7. 返回结果

```python
return x, y
```

* 每次调用 `next_batch()`，返回一对 `(x, y)`，形状是 `(B, T)`。
* 训练循环就能不断调用 `dataloader.next_batch()` 来获取新数据。

---

## ✅ 总结

这个 `DataLoaderLite` 做的事情就是：

1. **一次性读取文本** → 编码成 token 张量。
2. **维护一个指针** → 从 token 序列里按顺序切分出小 batch。
3. **构造 (x, y)** →

   * `x` 是输入 tokens。
   * `y` 是目标 tokens（比 `x` 向右错一位）。
4. **自动循环** → 数据读到结尾时自动回绕到开头。

---

👉 换句话说，这就是一个简化版的 **训练数据迭代器**，用来不断提供 `(x, y)` 给 GPT 模型。

要不要我帮你画一个 **buf → x,y 的错位示意图**，直观展示输入和目标是怎么对应的？

# 一个 epoch 什么意思

好问题 👍

在机器学习 / 深度学习训练里：

---

## 1. **epoch 的定义**

* **一个 epoch** = 模型 **完整看过一遍训练集**。
* 也就是说，把训练数据全部送进模型一轮，这就叫 **1 个 epoch**。

---

## 2. 关系：epoch、batch、iteration

* **batch（小批量）**：一次送进模型的一小部分样本。
* **iteration（迭代）**：**一次参数更新** = 前向传播 + 反向传播 + 优化器 step。
* **epoch**：训练集全部数据都被迭代过一遍。

公式：

$$
\text{#iterations per epoch} = \frac{\text{dataset size}}{\text{batch size}}
$$

---

## 3. 回到你代码里的打印

```python
print(f"1 epoch = {len(self.tokens) // (B * T)} batches")
```

* `len(self.tokens)` = 训练数据总 token 数。
* `B * T` = 每个 batch 消耗的 token 数。
* `len(self.tokens) // (B*T)` = 训练集可以切出多少个 batch。
* 也就是：**1 个 epoch 里一共能迭代多少个 batch**。

---

## 4. 举例

假设：

* 数据集总 token 数 = 10,000
* `B=4, T=50` → 每个 batch 用到 200 个 token

那么：

```
1 epoch = 10000 // 200 = 50 batches
```

也就是说：

* 迭代 50 个 batch，刚好把数据集完整过一遍 = 1 epoch。
* 如果训练 10 个 epoch，就相当于把整个数据集看了 10 遍。

---

✅ **总结**

* **epoch** = 模型完整遍历一次训练数据。
* 在你代码里，它表示 **用所有 tokens 正好切出多少个 batch**。

---

要不要我再帮你画一个小图，把 **dataset → batch → iteration → epoch** 的关系直观对比出来？

```
        # weight sharing scheme
        self.transformer.wte.weight = self.lm_head.weight
```

这两行是在做 **权重共享（weight tying）**：

```python
# weight sharing scheme
self.transformer.wte.weight = self.lm_head.weight
```

## 它到底做了什么？

* `wte` 是 **词嵌入矩阵**（`nn.Embedding`），形状是 `(vocab_size, n_embd)`。
* `lm_head` 是 **输出分类层**（`nn.Linear(n_embd, vocab_size, bias=False)`），其 `weight` 形状是 `(vocab_size, n_embd)`（PyTorch 的 Linear 权重是 `(out_features, in_features)`）。

两者形状完全一致，所以把它们**指向同一个参数对象**：

> 不是拷贝数据，而是让两个模块的 `.weight` **引用同一块参数**（同一个 `nn.Parameter`）。

因此：

* 训练时，这个参数的 **梯度来自两边（嵌入 + 输出头）**，会被一起累加，然后更新一次。
* 更新一次就同时影响嵌入和输出头，因为本质上就是**同一个权重**。

> 若你用的是 `copy_`（如 `wte.weight.data.copy_(lm_head.weight.data)`），那只是“值相同”，**不会共享**，之后会各自独立更新。这里的**赋值**是“同一对象”的共享。

---

## 为什么要这样做？（好处）

1. **省参数**：
   把原本两份大小为 `vocab_size × n_embd` 的矩阵合并为一份。
   以 GPT-2 小模型为例：`50257 × 768 ≈ 3,86e7` 个参数，FP32 大约 **154MB**，共享后能省下这一份（FP16 也能省 \~77MB）。

2. **正则化效果**（更稳、更准）：
   文献（Press & Wolf 2017；Inan et al. 2017）指出权重 tying 能降低困惑度（perplexity），常作为语言模型的默认配置。

3. **语义一致性**：
   输出 logits 的第 *i* 行用的就是词 *i* 的嵌入向量 `e_i` 与隐藏态 `h_t` 的点积：

   $$
   \text{logits}_t = h_t \, E^\top \quad (\text{其中 } E=\text{wte.weight}=\text{lm\_head.weight})
   $$

   也就是“**用同一组词向量做输入和输出**”。

---

## 与实现细节相关的注意点

* 需要 `lm_head` **无偏置**（`bias=False`），否则共享矩阵外再加一组偏置会破坏对称性，也不再是纯粹的 tying。
* 这是 **参数别名**（同一 `nn.Parameter`）：优化器不会“重复更新”。PyTorch 在收集参数时会基于对象 id 去重。
* 任何对其中一方 `.weight` 的 **原地修改**都会影响另一方（因为同一对象）。
* 如果后来又给任意一方重新赋一个新的 `nn.Parameter`，就**解绑**了（不再共享）。

---

## 小测试（验证是否共享）

```python
# 同一对象（id 一样）
id(model.transformer.wte.weight) == id(model.lm_head.weight)  # True

# 同一存储（底层地址一样）
model.transformer.wte.weight.data_ptr() == model.lm_head.weight.data_ptr()  # True
```

**一句话总结**：
这行代码让 **输入嵌入矩阵** 和 **输出分类权重** 共用同一参数，既省内存又常常更准，是现代语言模型的常见做法。


```
    def _init_weights(self, module):
        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
            std = 0.02
            if hasattr(module, 'NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT'):
                std *= (2 * self.config.n_layer) ** -0.5
            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std)
            if module.bias is not None:
                torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)
        elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):
            torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=0.02)
```

好 👌 这段 `_init_weights` 方法是 **自定义参数初始化函数**，在构造模型时会对 `Linear` 和 `Embedding` 层进行权重初始化。逐行来看：

---

## 1. 函数入口

```python
def _init_weights(self, module):
```

* 这个函数通常会被 `model.apply(self._init_weights)` 调用，遍历模型里的所有子模块，对每一层初始化。

---

## 2. 处理 `nn.Linear` 层

```python
if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
    std = 0.02
    if hasattr(module, 'NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT'):
        std *= (2 * self.config.n_layer) ** -0.5
    torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std)
    if module.bias is not None:
        torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)
```

### (1) 判断类型

* 如果子模块是 `nn.Linear`（全连接层），执行这个分支。

### (2) 设置标准差

* 默认 `std = 0.02`（和 GPT-2、BERT 的初始化一致）。
* 如果这个 `Linear` 层带有属性 `NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT`，则进一步缩放标准差：

  $$
  std = 0.02 \times (2 \cdot n\_layer)^{-0.5}
  $$

  → 这个技巧在 **残差连接深网络**里有时能改善稳定性。
  → 类似于 Transformer 里 "scaled initialization" 的思想。

### (3) 权重初始化

```python
torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=std)
```

* 用 **均值 0，标准差 std 的高斯分布**来初始化权重。

### (4) 偏置初始化

```python
if module.bias is not None:
    torch.nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)
```

* 如果有偏置，就全设为 0。

---

## 3. 处理 `nn.Embedding` 层

```python
elif isinstance(module, nn.Embedding):
    torch.nn.init.normal_(module.weight, mean=0.0, std=0.02)
```

* 词嵌入矩阵也用均值 0、标准差 0.02 的高斯分布初始化。
* 这是 GPT-2 论文里的做法：embedding 层和 Linear 层保持一致。

---

## 4. 为什么要这么做？

1. **保证训练稳定性**

   * 正态分布初始化能避免梯度过大/过小。
   * 标准差 0.02 是经验值，GPT-2/BERT 等模型采用的。

2. **残差网络的特殊缩放**

   * 深层 Transformer 中，如果不缩放，残差会让方差叠加，导致训练不稳定。
   * `(2*n_layer)^(-0.5)` 这个缩放是个 trick，可以让输出方差大致保持恒定。

3. **Embedding 与 Linear 对齐**

   * 输入嵌入、输出头、MLP、注意力里的 Linear 层，都保持一致的初始化分布。

---

## ✅ 总结

`_init_weights` 的作用是：

* **Linear 层**：权重用 `N(0, std^2)` 初始化，偏置设为 0；如果标记了 `NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT`，就额外缩放 std。
* **Embedding 层**：权重用 `N(0, 0.02^2)` 初始化。

这样保证了模型一开始的参数分布合理，有利于稳定训练。

---

要不要我顺便帮你解释一下 **为什么 GPT/BERT 都选择 `std=0.02`**，而不是 Xavier/He 初始化？

# Xavier initialization 解释一下

好问题 👍 你问的 **Xavier 初始化**（又叫 Glorot 初始化，Glorot & Bengio 2010）是深度学习里最经典的权重初始化方法之一。

---

## 1. 为什么需要特殊初始化？

* 如果权重初始化得太大：前向传播时激活会爆炸，反向传播时梯度也会爆炸。
* 如果权重初始化得太小：激活和梯度会逐层缩小，最后消失。
* 所以需要一种初始化方法，让**输入和输出的方差尽量保持一致**，避免梯度消失或爆炸。

---

## 2. 思想

Xavier 初始化的目标是：

$$
Var(Wx) \approx Var(x), \quad Var(\nabla W) \approx Var(\nabla x)
$$

也就是说：保持前向传播和反向传播中，信号的方差尽量恒定。

---

## 3. 公式

假设一层网络有：

* 输入维度 = $fan\_in$
* 输出维度 = $fan\_out$

那么权重 $W$ 初始化方式为：

* **均匀分布**（最常见）：

$$
W \sim U\left[-\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan\_in + fan\_out}}, \; \sqrt{\frac{6}{fan\_in + fan\_out}} \right]
$$

* **正态分布**（也常用）：

$$
W \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \; \frac{2}{fan\_in + fan\_out}\right)
$$

---

## 4. PyTorch 实现

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

linear = nn.Linear(128, 64)
nn.init.xavier_uniform_(linear.weight)   # 均匀分布版本
nn.init.xavier_normal_(linear.weight)    # 正态分布版本
```

---

## 5. 使用场景

* 常用于 **tanh / sigmoid 激活函数** 的网络。
* 在 ReLU 网络里，后来更流行 **He 初始化 (Kaiming Init)**，它更适合非对称的 ReLU 激活。

---

## 6. 和 GPT/BERT 初始化的区别

* GPT/BERT 用的是 **高斯分布 N(0, 0.02²)** 固定 std，而不是 Xavier。
* 这是经验选择，和 Transformer 的残差结构、LayerNorm 结合后，能保持训练稳定。
* 如果不用 LayerNorm，那 Xavier/He 初始化更常见。

---

✅ **一句话总结**
Xavier 初始化通过考虑输入/输出维度，自动选择权重范围，让信号在前向和反向传播时保持方差稳定，从而避免梯度爆炸或消失。

---

要不要我再帮你对比一下 **Xavier 初始化 vs He 初始化**，看看它们各自适合哪些激活函数？

# 为什么要乘以2

啊～你说的是这段初始化里的：

```python
if hasattr(module, 'NANOGPT_SCALE_INIT'):
    std *= (2 * self.config.n_layer) ** -0.5
```

关键就是这个 `2 * self.config.n_layer`，为什么要有个 **2**。

---

## 1. 背景：深层 Transformer 的残差

在 GPT 这种模型里，堆叠了很多层，每层都有 **残差连接 (residual connection)**：

$$
x_{l+1} = x_l + f(x_l)
$$

其中 $f(x_l)$ 是注意力或 MLP。

* 每层都会往残差里加一个“增量”。
* 如果不缩放，增量的方差会随层数累积，越到深层越大，训练可能不稳定。

---

## 2. 为什么是 `(2 * n_layer)^(-0.5)`？

这个缩放思想来自 **DeepNet/Transformer Scaling Trick**（见 GPT-NeoX 和一些训练技巧总结）：

* **n\_layer 部分**

  * 每层的增量大概有 `n_layer` 次累加。
  * 为了让总方差保持常数，需要让每层初始化时的方差缩小大约 $1/\sqrt{n\_layer}$。

* **乘以 2**

  * 一个完整的 Transformer block 里有 **两个残差路径**：

    1. Multi-Head Self-Attention (注意力分支)
    2. MLP (前馈网络分支)
  * 也就是说，在每一层里，残差里会加两次增量。
  * 所以总的累加次数 ≈ $2 \times n\_layer$。
  * 为了抵消这点，就要用 $(2 \times n\_layer)^{-0.5}$ 来缩放标准差。

---

## 3. 直观理解

* 如果只有一个残差分支，每层的缩放因子是 $(n\_layer)^{-0.5}$。
* 但 Transformer block 有两个残差分支 → 方差累积速度翻倍。
* 所以要写成 $(2 \times n\_layer)^{-0.5}$。

---

## ✅ 总结

这里的 **2** 来自 Transformer block 里有 **两条残差路径（Attention + MLP）**。
所以为了让信号方差在层数增加时保持稳定，初始化时要把标准差额外缩小一倍：

$$
std = 0.02 \times (2 \cdot n\_layer)^{-0.5}
$$

---

要不要我帮你画一张 **残差累积 vs 缩放因子** 的小示意图，让你更直观理解为什么是 `2*n_layer` 而不是 `n_layer`？



# optimization loop: overfit a single batch

here we have the loss is this is how we get the loss but now basically we want a load
for Loop here so 4 I in range let's do 50 steps or something like that uh let's create an Optimizer object in
pytorch um and so here we are using the atom um Optimizer which is an
alternative to the stochastic radian descent Optimizer SGD that we were using so SGD is a lot simpler atom is a bit
more involved and I actually specifically like the atom W variation because in my opinion it kind of just
like fixes a bug um so adom w is a bug fix of atom is what I would say when we
go to the documentation for atom W oh my gosh we see um that it takes a bunch of
hyper parameters and it's a little bit more complicated than the SGD we were looking at before uh because in addition
to basically updating the parameters with the gradient uh scaled by the Learning rate it keeps these buffers
around and it keeps two buffers the m and the V which it calls the first and the second moment so something that
looks a bit like momentum and something that looks a bit like RMS prop if you're familiar with it but you don't have to
be it's just kind of a normalization that happens on each gradient element individually and speeds up the
optimization especially for language models but I'm not going to go into the detail right here we're going to treat
it as a bit of a black box and it just optimizes um the objective faster than
SGD which is what we've seen in the previous lectures so let's use it as a black box in our case uh create the
optimizer object and then go through the optimization
the first thing to always make sure the co-pilot did not forget to zero the gradients so um always remember that you
have to start with a zero gradient then when you get your loss and you do a DOT backward dot backward adds to gradients
so it deposits gradients it it always does a plus equals on whatever the gradients are which is why you must set
them to zero so this accumulates the gradient from this loss and then we call the step function on the optimizer to um
update the parameters and to um decrease the loss and then we print a step and the
loss do item is used here because loss is a tensor with a single element do item will actually uh convert that to a
single float and this float will live not will will live on the CPU so this
gets to some of the internals again of the devices but loss is a is a tensor with a single element and it lifts on
GPU for me because I'm using gpus when you call item P torch behind the scenes
will take that one-dimensional tensor ship it back to the CPU uh memory and convert it into a float that we can just
print so this is the optimization and this should probably just
work let's see what happens actually sorry let me instead of
using CPU override let me delete that so this is a bit faster for me and it runs on Cuda
oh expected all tensors to be on the same device but found at least two devices Cuda zero and CPU so Cuda zero
is the zeroth GPU because I actually have eight gpus on this box uh so the zeroth GPU in my box and CPU and model
we have moved to device but when I was writing this code I actually introduced a bug because buff we never moved to
device and you have to be careful because you can't just do buff dot two of
device um it's not stateful it doesn't convert it to be a device it instead uh
returns pointer to a new memory which is on the device so you see how we can just do model that two a device that does not
apply to tensors you have to do buff equals um b.2 device and then this should work
okay so what do we expect to see we expect to see a reasonable loss in the beginning and then we continue to
optimize just the single batch and so we want to see that we can overfit this single batch we can we can crush this
little batch and we can perfectly predict the indices on just this little batch and indeed that is roughly what
we're seeing here so um we started off at roughly 10.82 11
in this case and then as we continue optimizing on this single batch without loading new examples we are making sure
that we can overfit a single batch and we are getting to very very low loss so the Transformer is memorizing this
single individual batch and one more thing I didn't mention is uh the learning rate here is 3 E4 which is a
pretty good default for most uh optimizations that you want to run at a very early debugging stage so this is
our simple inter Loop and uh we are overfitting a single batch and this looks good so now what uh what comes
next is we don't just want to overfit a single batch we actually want to do an optimization so we actually need to iterate these XY batches and create a
little data loader uh that makes sure that we're always getting a fresh batch and that we're actually optimizing a
reasonable objective so let's do that next okay so this is what I came up with and I wrote a little data loader

当然，以下是这段内容的中文解释：

## 优化循环：在单个批次上过拟合（Overfit a Single Batch）

### 1. 创建优化器（Optimizer）

为了开始优化模型，我们需要一个优化器。在这里，我们使用 **AdamW** 优化器，而不是之前讲解的 **SGD**（随机梯度下降）。AdamW 是 Adam 优化器的一个变种，特别适用于处理具有权重衰减（weight decay）的任务，比如语言模型训练。

* **AdamW** 优化器不仅使用梯度来更新模型参数，还维护两个缓冲区：**m** 和 **v**，分别代表第一个和第二个矩（类似于动量和 RMSprop）。这些缓冲区帮助对每个梯度元素进行标准化，从而加速优化过程，尤其是在训练语言模型时表现得更好。

尽管 AdamW 比 SGD 更复杂，但它能够更有效地优化目标函数，因此我们可以将其当作一个“黑箱”，直接使用它来进行优化。

### 2. 优化过程

在优化过程中，每一步需要注意以下几点：

* **零化梯度**：每次开始计算之前，必须使用 `optimizer.zero_grad()` 将梯度清零，因为 PyTorch 默认会在每次反向传播时累加梯度。如果不清零，梯度会不断累积，从而导致不正确的更新。

* **计算梯度并反向传播**：使用 `loss.backward()` 计算损失函数的梯度，并将梯度存储在模型的参数中。

* **更新参数**：通过 `optimizer.step()` 更新模型的参数，以最小化损失。

* **打印损失**：我们可以打印出损失值以跟踪训练进度。因为损失是一个包含单一元素的张量，我们需要使用 `.item()` 方法将其转换为普通的浮动数值，然后打印出来。

```python
loss.item()
```

### 3. 调试模式下的学习率

在优化初期，学习率（learning rate）通常设定为较小的值。在本例中，学习率设定为 `3e-4`，这是大多数优化任务在调试阶段的一个良好默认值。这个学习率能够确保训练稳定，防止过快跳过最优解。

### 4. 在单个批次上过拟合

在这个优化过程中，我们的目标是**在单个批次上过拟合**，也就是让模型能够完美地预测该批次中的所有 token。在训练初期，我们看到损失从初始的 **10.82**（理论值）逐渐降低，接近 **0**，这说明模型已经能够“记住”这个小批次的数据，达到了完美的拟合。

### 5. 设备管理（Device Handling）

在这段代码中，也有关于设备（CPU 和 GPU）的管理：

* 模型和数据需要确保位于同一设备上，不能同时存在于不同设备（如 CPU 和 GPU）上。
* 当使用多 GPU 时，需要特别小心，因为某些缓存（如 `buff`）未自动迁移到设备上。为此，我们需要使用 `buff = buff.to(device)` 来确保数据和模型在同一设备上。

### 6. 下一步：优化多个批次

虽然我们在单个批次上成功进行了过拟合，但我们的目标是让模型在多个批次上进行优化。接下来，我们将：

* 创建一个 **数据加载器**（DataLoader），确保每次都能获取到一个新的批次；
* 进行多次训练，优化一个合理的目标，而不仅仅是记住一个单一批次。

---

### 总结

* 我们使用 **AdamW 优化器** 来优化模型，确保能够有效地训练语言模型。
* 在优化过程中，必须清除梯度、计算损失并进行反向传播。
* 我们通过在单个批次上过拟合，确保优化过程正常，并成功降低了损失值。
* 下一步，我们将引入 **数据加载器**，使模型能够在多个批次上进行训练。

# data loader lite

light um so what this data loader does is we're importing the token up here
we're reading the entire text file from this single input.txt tokenizing it and then we're just
printing the number of tokens in total and the number of batches in a single Epoch of iterating over this data set so
how many unique batches do we output before we loop back around the beginning of the document and start reading it
again so we start off at position zero and then we simply walk the document in
batches of B * T so we take chunks of B * T and then always Advance by B * T and
um it's important to note that we're always advancing our position by exactly B * T but when we're fetching the tokens
we're actually fetching from current position to B * t + 1 and we need that
plus one because remember uh we need the target token um for the last token in the current
batch and so that way we can do um the XY exactly as we did it before and if we
are to um run out of data we'll just loop back around to zero so this is one
way to write a very very simple data loader um that simply just goes through the file in chunks and is good enough
for us uh for current purposes and we're going to complexify it later and now
we'd like to come back around here and we'd like to actually use our data loader so the import Tik token has moved
up and actually all of this is now useless so instead we just want a train
loader for the training data and we want to use the same hyper parameters for four so B size was four and time was
32 and then here we need to get the XY for the current batch so let's see if
copal gets it because this is simple enough uh so we call the next batch and then we um make sure that we have to
move our tensors from CPU to the device
so here when I converted the tokens notice that I didn't actually move these tokens to the GPU I left them on CPU
which is the default um and that's just because I'm trying not to waste too much memory on the GPU in this case this is a
tiny data set and it would fit uh but it's fine to just uh ship it to GPU right now for for our purposes right now
so we get the next batch we keep the data loader simple CPU class and then here we actually ship it to the GPU and
do all the computation and uh let's see if this runs so python train gbt2 pi and
what do we expect to see before this actually happens what we expect to see is now we're actually getting the next batch so we expect to not overfit a
single batch and so I expect our loss to come down but not too much and that's
because I still expect it to come down because in the 50257 tokens many of those tokens never
occur in our data set so there are some very easy gains to be made here in the optimization by for example taking the
biases of all the loits that never occur and driving them to negative infinity and that would basically just it's just
that all of these crazy unic codes or different languages those tokens never occur so their probability should be
very low and so the gains that we should be seeing are along the lines of basically deleting the usage of tokens
that never occur that's probably most of the loss gain that we're going to see at this scale right now uh but we shouldn't
come to a zero uh because um we are only doing 50 iterations and I don't think
that's enough to do an eoch right now so let's see what we got we um we have 338,000
tokens which makes sense with our 3:1 compression ratio because there are 1 million uh characters so one Epoch with
the current setting of B and T will take 2, 600 batches and we're only doing 50
batches of optimization in here so we start off in a familiar territory as expected and then we seem
to come down to about 6.6 so basically things seem to be working okay right now
with respect to our expectations so that's good okay next I want to actually fix a bug that we have in our code um

## 数据加载器简化版（Data Loader Lite）

### 1. 数据加载器的作用

这个 **数据加载器** 的作用是：

* 我们首先导入 **tiktoken** 库。
* 然后读取整个文本文件（`input.txt`），对其进行分词。
* 接着，打印出总共的 **token 数量** 以及一个 **epoch** 中的批次数量，表示在遍历整个数据集时，我们能够生成多少个批次。

### 2. 处理数据的方式

我们从文件的开头开始，按 **批次大小 B \* T**（批次大小和序列长度的乘积）来分批处理数据。每次读取一个批次的 token，并将当前位置推进 **B \* T**。这里的关键点是：

* 每次获取的数据是从当前的位置开始，到 **B \* T + 1**（额外多取一个 token），这样做是因为我们需要获取目标 token（即当前批次中最后一个 token 的下一个 token），以便计算损失。

* 如果数据集的内容读取完了，我们就会从头开始重新读取数据，这样保证数据能循环利用，适用于训练中。

### 3. 简单的数据加载器实现

我们实现了一个非常简化的 **数据加载器**，它通过不断从文件中按批次读取数据来训练模型，足够满足当前的调试需求。之后，我们会在此基础上进一步复杂化。

### 4. 训练数据加载与处理

接下来，我们希望利用这个数据加载器来获取训练数据。首先，我们移动了 `Tik token` 的导入部分，并简化了一些不再需要的部分。然后，我们创建了一个 **训练数据加载器**（`train_loader`），并设置了训练时使用的超参数：

* 批次大小（B size）：4
* 序列长度（T）：32

通过 `train_loader` 获取当前批次的数据后，我们需要确保 **数据张量** 从 **CPU** 转移到 **GPU**。虽然数据集较小，理论上可以直接使用 **CPU** 处理，但为了加速计算，我们将数据转移到 **GPU** 上进行处理。

### 5. 期望的优化效果

我们现在开始进行模型训练，并观察损失函数的变化。由于数据集很小，所以我们不指望模型会在一个批次上完美过拟合。我们期望损失会下降，但不会降得太快，因为数据集中的许多 token 在训练中是从未出现过的。这些 **不出现的 token** 的概率应该非常低，我们可以通过 **调整损失** 来处理这些 token，使它们的预测值趋近于零。

* 在训练初期，模型会快速对这些未出现的 token 进行优化，调整它们的权重。
* 预计随着训练的进行，损失值会逐步下降到合理范围，但不会降到零，因为我们只是做了 **50 次优化步骤**（还不够一个完整的 Epoch）。

### 6. 批次与数据集大小

在当前设置下，我们有 **338,000 个 token**，根据 **3:1 的压缩比**，意味着原始文本文件约有 **1 百万字符**。以当前的批次大小（B=4，T=32）进行训练，每个 Epoch 将包含 **2600 个批次**，但我们只进行 **50 次优化步骤**。因此，模型的损失值将逐步下降，但我们还不能期待在这么少的步骤中就达到完美的效果。

通过训练后，我们的损失值从大约 **10.82** 开始，逐渐下降到 **6.6**，这是符合预期的。模型开始正常工作，损失值逐步降低。

### 7. 修复代码中的 bug

最后，作者提到代码中存在一个 bug，需要修复。这个 bug 可能影响到模型训练的效率，后续会对其进行修复。

---

### 总结

* **数据加载器**：通过简单的代码从文件中批次加载数据，并按需重新开始。
* **训练数据处理**：使用分批的方式处理数据，保证每个批次的数据能在 **GPU** 上计算。
* **损失计算与优化**：通过交叉熵损失函数计算模型的损失，并使用优化器（AdamW）进行优化。
* **期望效果**：在训练过程中，损失逐渐下降，但由于训练步骤较少，损失不会降到零。

# parameter sharing wte and lm_head

it's not a major bug but it is a bug with respect to how gpt2 training uh should
happen um so the buck is the following we were not being careful enough when we were
loading the weights from hugging face and we actually missed a little detail so if we come
here notice that um the shape of these two tensors is the same so this one here
is the token embedding at the bottom of the Transformer right so and this one here
is the language modeling head at the top of the Transformer and both of these are
basically two-dimensional tensors and they shape is identical so here the
first one is the output embedding the token embedding and the second one is this linear layer at the very top the
classifier layer both of them are of shape 50257 X
768 um this one here is giving us our token embeddings at the bottom and this
one here is taking the 768 channels of the Transformer and trying to upscale
that to 50, 257 to get the Lis for the next token so they're both the same
shape but more than that actually if you look at um comparing their elements um
in pytorch this is an element wise equality so then we use do all and we see that every single element is
identical and more than that we see that if we actually look at the data pointer
uh this is what this is a way in pytorch to get the actual pointer to the uh data and the storage we see that actually the
pointer is identical so not only are these two separate tensors that happen to have the same shape and elements
they're actually pointing to the identical tensor so what's happening here is that this is a common weight
tying scheme uh that actually comes from the original um from the original attention is all
you need paper and actually even the reference before it so if we come
here um eddings and softmax in the attention
is all you need paper they mentioned that in our model we shared the same weight Matrix between the two embedding
layers and the pre softmax linear transformation similar to 30 um so this
is an awkward way to phrase that these two are shared and they're tied and they're the same Matrix and the 30
reference is this paper um so this came out in 2017 and you can read the full paper but
basically it argues for this weight tying scheme and I think intuitively the
idea for why you might want to do this comes from from this paragraph here and basically you you can observe
that um you actually want these two matrices to behave similar in the
following sense if two tokens are very similar semantically like maybe one of
them is all lowercase and the other one is all uppercase or it's the same token in a different language or something like that if you have similarity between
two tokens presumably you would expect that they are uh nearby in the token embedding space but in the exact same
way you'd expect that if you have two tokens that are similar semantically you'd expect them to get the same
probabilities at the output of a transformer because they are semantically similar and so both
positions in the Transformer at the very bottom and at the top have this property that similar tokens should have similar
embeddings or similar weights and so this is what motivates their exploration
here and they they kind of you know I don't want to go through the entire paper and and uh you can go through it
but this is what they observe they also observe that if you look at the output embeddings they also behave like word
embeddings um if you um if you just kind of try to use those weights as word
embeddings um so they kind of observe this similarity they try to tie them and they observe that they can get much
better performance in that way and so this was adopted and the attention is all need paper and then it was used
again in gpt2 as well so I couldn't find it in the
Transformers implementation I'm not sure where they tie those embeddings but I can find it in the original gpt2 code U
introduced by open aai so this is um openai gpt2 Source model and here where
they are forwarding this model and this is in tensorflow but uh that's okay we see that they get the wte token
embeddings and then here is the incoder of the token embeddings and the
position and then here at the bottom they Ed the WT again to do the lits so
when they get the loits it's a math Mo of uh this output from the Transformer and the wte tensor is
reused um and so the wte tensor basically is used twice on the bottom of the Transformer and on the top of the
Transformer and in the backward pass we'll get gradients contributions from both branches right and these gradients
will add up um on the wte tensor um so we'll get a contribution from the
classifier list and then at the very end of the Transformer we'll get a contribution at the at the bottom of it float floating
again into the wte uh tensor so we want to we are currently not sharing WT and
our code but we want to do that um
so weight sharing scheme um and one way to do this let's see if goil gets it oh
it does okay uh so this is one way to do it
uh basically relatively straightforward what we're doing here is we're taking the wte do weight and we're simply uh
redirecting it to point to the LM head so um this basically copies the data
pointer right it copies the reference and now the wte weight becomes orphaned
uh the old value of it and uh pytorch will clean it up python will clean it up
and so we are only left with a single tensor and it's going to be used twice
in the forward pass and uh this is to my knowledge all that's required so we
should be able to use this and this should probably train uh we're just going to basically be using this exact
same sensor twice and um we weren't being careful with
tracking the likelihoods but uh according to the paper and according to the results you'd actually expect slightly better results doing this and
in addition to that one other reason that this is very very nice for us is that this is a ton of parameters right
uh what is the size here it's 768 * 50257 so This Is 40 million parameters
and this is a 124 million parameter model so 40 divide 124 so this is like
30% of the parameters are being saved using this weight time scheme and so
this might be one of the reasons that this is working slightly better if you're not training the model long enough because of the weight tying uh
you don't have to train as many parameters and so you become more efficient um in terms of the training
process uh because you have fewer parameters and you're putting in this inductive bias that these two embeddings
should share similarities between tokens so this is the way time scheme and we've
saved a ton of parameters and we expect our model to work slightly better because of the scheme okay next I would

## 权重共享：`wte` 和 `lm_head`

### 1. 权重共享问题

在训练 GPT-2 模型时，我们遇到了一个小问题，主要是在加载 Hugging Face 的预训练权重时，漏掉了一个细节。具体来说，问题出在 **`wte`（token embedding）** 和 **`lm_head`（语言模型头）** 的权重没有共享。

* **`wte`** 是 Transformer 中底部的 token 嵌入（token embedding），它的作用是将 token 索引映射为嵌入向量。
* **`lm_head`** 是 Transformer 顶部的线性层，它的作用是将 Transformer 的输出映射到词汇表大小，用于生成下一个 token 的概率分布。

这两个部分的权重形状是相同的，都是 `[50257, 768]`（50257 是词汇表大小，768 是嵌入维度）。然而，它们的内容实际上是相同的，**它们指向相同的内存地址**。也就是说，**这两个张量使用的是相同的权重**，这就是 **权重共享**（weight tying）。

### 2. 权重共享的动机

权重共享的动机来自于原始的 Transformer 论文《Attention is All You Need》。在这篇论文中，作者提到在模型的 **token 嵌入层** 和 **预 softmax 线性层** 之间共享权重。这是因为这些层的作用是相似的，都是处理词汇信息。

* 在语言模型中，语义相似的 token（例如相同单词的小写和大写形式）应该有相似的嵌入和输出概率分布。
* 因此，如果两个 token 在语义上相似，它们在嵌入空间中的位置应该接近，并且在生成下一个 token 时，模型也应该为它们分配相似的概率。

这种 **权重共享** 的做法可以帮助模型提高性能，同时减少参数数量。由于两个矩阵共享同一个权重，模型的训练效率提高了，特别是在训练较大的语言模型时，这种做法能节省大量内存和计算资源。

### 3. 权重共享的实现

在实际实现中，我们发现 Hugging Face 的代码没有明确地进行权重共享，因此我们需要手动处理这一问题。我们可以通过以下方法来实现权重共享：

```python
# 将 wte 权重共享给 lm_head
model.lm_head.weight = model.wte.weight
```

这段代码的作用是将 **`wte`** 权重的引用赋值给 **`lm_head`**，从而实现 **权重共享**。这样，`wte` 和 `lm_head` 就指向同一块内存空间，确保它们使用相同的权重。

### 4. 权重共享的好处

* **节省参数**：由于 **`wte`** 和 **`lm_head`** 使用相同的权重，这就减少了 40 百万（768 \* 50257）的参数，这对于 124 百万参数的模型来说，相当于节省了大约 30% 的参数。
* **提高训练效率**：减少参数量使得训练变得更加高效，尤其是在模型训练时间较短时，能够有效避免过多的参数造成的训练不稳定。
* **提高模型性能**：通过共享权重，模型在处理语义相似的 token 时能够表现得更好，因为它将这两部分的权重约束为相同，能够更好地捕捉到语义相似性。

### 5. 权重共享的原理

这种权重共享的方式体现了一种 **归纳偏置**（inductive bias），即：**token 嵌入和输出概率之间应该有相似性**。这种约束使得模型在训练过程中更加高效，减少了过拟合的风险，并且能够更好地处理语义相似的 token。

### 总结

* **权重共享** 是一个常见的技术，尤其在语言模型中非常有效。通过共享 **`wte`** 和 **`lm_head`** 的权重，我们减少了模型的参数，并提高了训练效率和性能。
* 这种做法来源于原始 Transformer 论文，并被 GPT-2 等模型广泛使用。
* 实现方法相对简单，只需要将 **`wte`** 的权重引用赋给 **`lm_head`** 即可。

# model initialization: std 0.02, residual init

like us to be a bit more careful with the initialization and to try to follow the way gpt2 initialized their model now
unfortunately the gpt2 paper and the gpt3 paper are not very explicit about initialization so we kind of have to
read between the lines uh and instead of going to the paper which is quite vague um there's a bit of information in the
code that open I released so when we go to the model.py we see that when they initialize their weights they are using
the standard deviation of 0.02 and that's how they they so this is
a normal distribution for the weights and the standard deviation is 0.02 for the bias they initialize that
with zero and then when we scroll down here why is this not scrolling
um the token embeddings are initialized at 0.02 and position embeddings at 0.01 for
some reason so those are the initializations and we'd like to mirror that in gpt2 uh in our module here so here's a
snippet of code that I sort of came up with very quickly so what's happening here is at
the end of our initializer for the GPT module we're calling the apply function of NN module and that iterates all the
sub modules of this module and uh applies in it weights function on them
and so what's happening here is that we're in we're iterating all the modules here and if they are an nn. linear
module then we're going to make sure to initialize the weight using a normal with the standard deviation of
0.02 if there's a bias in this layer we will make sure to initialize that to zero note that zero initialization for
the bias is not actually the pyto default um by default the bias here is
initialized with a uniform so uh that's interesting so we make sure to use zero
and for the embedding we're just going to use 0.02 and um keep it the same um so we're not going to change it to 0.01
for positional because it's about the same and then if you look through our model the only other layer that requires
initialization and that has parameters is the layer norm and the fighter defer initialization sets the scale in the
layer Norm to be one and the offset in the layer Norm to be zero so that's exactly what we want and so we're just
going to uh keep it that way and so this is the default initialization if we are
following the um where is it the uh gpt2
uh source code that they released I would like to point out by the way that um typically the standard deviation here
on this initialization if you follow the Javier initialization would be one of over the square root of the number of
features that are incoming into this layer but if you'll notice actually 0.02 is basically consistent with that
because the the model sizes inside these Transformers for gpt2 are roughly 768 1600 Etc so 1 over the square root of
for example 768 gives us 0.03 if we plug in 600 1,600 we get
0.02 if we plug in three times that 0.014 Etc so basically 0.02 is roughly
in the vicinity of reasonable values for the for um for these initializations
anyway so so it's not uh completely crazy to be hard coding 0.02 here uh but
you'd like typically uh some something that grows with the model size instead
but we will keep this because that is the gpt2 initialization per their source code but we are not fully done yet on
initialization because there's one more caveat here so here a mod initialization which accounts
for the accumulation on the residual path with model depth is used we scale the weight of residual layers of
initialization by factor of one over squ of n where n is the number of residual layers so this is what gbt2 paper says
so we have not implemented that yet and uh we can do so now now I'd like to actually kind of like motivate a little
bit what they mean here I think um so here's roughly what they
mean if you start out with zeros in your residual stream remember that each
residual stream is a is of this form where we continue adding to it X is X
plus something some kind of contribution so every single block of the residual uh
Network contributes some uh amount and it gets added and so what ends up
happening is that the variance of the activations in the residual stream grows
so here's a small example if we start at zero and then we for 100 times uh we
have sort of this residual stream of of 768 uh zeros and then 100 times we add
um random which is a normal distribution zero mean one standard deviation if we
add to it then by the end the residual stream has grown to have standard deviation of 10 and that's just because
um we're always adding um these numbers
and so this scaling factor that they use here exactly compensates for that growth
so if we take n and we basically um scale down every one of these
contributions into the residual stream by one over theare Ro of n so 1 over theun of n is n to the 0.5
right because n the5 is the square root and then one over the square root is n.5
if we scale it in this way then we see that we actually get um
one so this is a way to control the growth of of activations inside the residual
stream in the forward pass and so we'd like to initialize in the same way where these weights that are at the end of
each block so this C uh layer uh the gbt paper proposes to scale down those
weights by one over the square root of the number of residual layers so one crude way to implement
this is the following I don't know if this is uh pyro sanctioned but it works for me is we'll do in the
initialization see that s that do special nanog GPT uh scale in it is one so we're
setting um kind of like a flag for this module there must be a better way in py torch right but I don't
know okay so we're basically attaching this flag and trying to make sure that it doesn't conflict with anything
previously and then when we come down here this STD should be 0.02 by default
but then if haat um module of this thing
then STD * equals
um copal is not guessing correctly uh so we want one over the square root of the number of layers so
um the number of residual layers here is twice times Salt out config layers and then
this times .5 so we want to scale down that standard deviation and this should
be um correct and Implement that I should clarify by the way that the two times number of layers comes from the
fact that every single one of our layers in the Transformer actually has two blocks that add to the ridal pathway
right we have the attention and then the MLP so that's where the two times comes from and the other thing to mention is
that uh what's slightly awkward but we're not going to fix it is that um
because we are weight sharing the wte and the LM head in this iteration of our
old subm modules we're going to actually come around to that tensor twice so we're going to first initialize it as an
embedding with 0.02 and then we're going to come back around it again in a linear and initialize it again using 0.02 and
it's going to be 0.02 because the LM head is of course not not scaled so it's not going to come here it's just it's
going to be basically initialized twice using the identical same initialization but that's okay and then scrolling over
here I added uh some code here so that we have reproducibility um to set the seeds and
now we should be able to python train gpt2 pi and let this running and as far
as I know this is the gpt2 initialization uh in the way we've implemented it right now so this
looks uh reasonable to me okay so at this point we have the gpt2 model we

## 模型初始化：标准差 0.02 和残差初始化

### 1. 初始化权重

我们需要更小心地初始化模型，以便与 GPT-2 的初始化方法相一致。不幸的是，**GPT-2 论文** 和 **GPT-3 论文** 对初始化的描述并不详细，因此我们需要从代码中推测具体细节。通过查看 OpenAI 发布的代码，我们发现他们使用了以下初始化方法：

* **权重初始化**：权重使用 **标准差 0.02** 的正态分布进行初始化。
* **偏置初始化**：偏置被初始化为 **0**。
* **Token 嵌入（WTE）**：Token 嵌入使用 **标准差 0.02** 初始化。
* **位置嵌入**：位置嵌入初始化为 **标准差 0.01**（这个值略有不同，但差异不大）。

我们希望在我们的模型中模拟这些初始化设置，以确保与 GPT-2 一致。

### 2. 如何初始化模型

在 GPT 模块的初始化过程中，我们使用 `apply` 函数，它会遍历所有子模块并对它们进行初始化：

* **线性层（nn.Linear）**：对于每个线性层，我们使用 **标准差 0.02** 初始化权重。如果该层有偏置，则初始化为 0。
* **嵌入层（Embedding）**：Token 嵌入层初始化为 **标准差 0.02**，位置嵌入层初始化为 **标准差 0.01**。
* **层归一化（LayerNorm）**：层归一化的 **scale** 被初始化为 **1**，**offset** 被初始化为 **0**。

这种初始化方法符合 GPT-2 的实现。

### 3. 标准差的选择

通常，权重初始化使用 Xavier 初始化，即权重的标准差应该是输入特征数的倒数的平方根。根据 GPT-2 的模型设置，标准差 **0.02** 近似符合这一要求。例如：

* 对于输入特征数为 **768** 的情况，标准差应为 **1 / sqrt(768) ≈ 0.036**，而 0.02 很接近这个值。
* 对于更大的模型（如 **1600**），标准差 **0.02** 也符合预期。

因此，标准差 0.02 是一个合理的初始化值。

### 4. 残差路径的初始化

GPT-2 还对残差路径的初始化做了处理。在每一层的残差路径中，随着网络深度的增加，激活值的方差会逐渐增大。为了避免这种情况，GPT-2 在初始化时使用了一个 **缩放因子**，通过缩放每个残差层的权重来控制激活值的增长。

* **缩放因子**：该因子为 **1 / sqrt(n)**，其中 **n** 是残差层的数量。这样可以确保随着层数增加，激活值的增长不会失控。

在实现中，我们将每一层的权重根据层数进行缩放，确保每个残差路径的贡献不会过大。

### 5. 权重共享

我们还注意到，**`wte`（token embedding）** 和 **`lm_head`（语言模型头）** 之间的权重是共享的。即 **`wte`** 用于生成 token 嵌入，而 **`lm_head`** 用于将 Transformer 输出映射到词汇表大小。在 GPT-2 中，这两个部分共享相同的权重，这样可以减少模型的参数数量，并且帮助模型在训练时更有效地捕捉语义相似性。

* 由于我们使用了 **权重共享**，`wte` 和 `lm_head` 会指向同一块内存，因此我们需要确保在初始化时正确地处理这两个层的权重。

### 6. 重复初始化与模型参数

由于我们在训练时对 `wte` 和 `lm_head` 使用了相同的权重，所以我们要确保它们在模型的前向传播和反向传播过程中能正确更新。在初始化时，我们首先初始化 `wte`，然后将其指向 `lm_head`，确保这两个层的权重共享。

### 7. 参数节省与训练效率

使用权重共享的好处之一是能够节省大量参数。`wte` 和 `lm_head` 的权重形状是 **50257 x 768**，这占用了约 40 百万个参数。通过共享这两个部分的权重，我们可以节省大量的内存和计算资源，尤其是在训练过程中不需要重复存储这部分权重。

总的来说，这种权重共享的方式不仅减少了模型的参数数量，还帮助模型在训练过程中更有效地捕捉语义信息，减少了过拟合的风险。

### 8. 可复现性与调试

为了确保训练过程的可复现性，我们在初始化时还设置了 **随机种子**，保证每次训练的结果是一致的。这样有助于我们调试模型并进行多次实验。

---

### 总结

* 我们通过使用 **标准差 0.02** 初始化权重，并按照 GPT-2 的实现方式初始化模型，确保了模型的初始化与 GPT-2 一致。
* 通过 **权重共享**（`wte` 和 `lm_head`），我们节省了大量的参数，并提高了训练效率。
* 通过 **残差路径的初始化**，我们控制了激活值的增长，避免了梯度消失或爆炸的问题。

这种初始化方法符合 GPT-2 的源代码，帮助我们提高了训练的稳定性和效率。

# SECTION 2: Let’s make it fast. GPUs, mixed precision, 1000ms

have some confidence that it's correctly implemented we've initialized it properly and we have a data loader that's iterating through data batches
and we can train so now comes the fun part I'd like us to speed up the training by a lot so we're getting our
money's worth with respect to the hardware that we are uh using here and uh we're going to speed up the training
by quite a bit uh now you always want to start with what Hardware do you have what does it offer and are you fully
utilizing it so in my case if we go to Nvidia SMI we can see
that I have eight gpus and each one of those gpus is an a100 sxm 80 gb so this
is the GPU that I have available to me in this box now when I look when I use
um to spin up these kinds of Boxes by the way my favorite place to go to is Lambda Labs um they do sponsor my
development and that of my projects uh but I this is my favorite place to go
and this is where you can spin up one of these machines and you pay per hour and it's very very simple so I like to spin them up and then
connect vsod to it and that's how I develop now when we look at the A1 100s that are available here a100 80 GB sxm
is the um GPU that I have here and we have a bunch of numbers here for um how
many calculations you can expect out of this GPU so when I come over here and I break in right after here so
python trity so I'm breaking in right after we calculate the loit and
laws and the interesting thing I'd like you to note is when I do lit. dtype this
prints a torch. FL 32 so by default iny torch when you create tensors um and
this is the case for all the activations and for the parameters of the network and so on by default everything is in float 32 that means that every single
number activation or weight and so on is using a float representation that has 32
bits and uh that's actually quite a bit of memory and it turns out empirically that for deep learning as a
computational workload this is way too much and deep learning and the training of these networks can tolerate
significantly lower precisions um not all computational workflows can tolerate small Precision so for example um if we
go back to to the data sheet you'll see that actually these gpus support up to fp64 and this is quite useful I
understand for a lot of um scientific Computing applications and there really need this uh but we don't need that much
Precision for deep learning training So currently we are here fp32 and with this code as it is right
now we expect to get at at most 19.5 Tera flops of performance that means
we're doing 19.5 trillion operations floating Point operations so this is floating Point multiply add most um most
likely and so these are the floating Point operations
uh now notice that if we are willing to go down in Precision so tf32 is a lower
Precision format we're going to see in a second you can actually get an 8X Improvement here and if you're willing
to go down to float 16 or B float 16 you can actually get time 16x performance
all the way to 312 Tera flops you see here that Nvidia likes to site numbers
that have an asterisk here this asterisk uh says with sparsity uh but we are not going to be using sparsity in R code and
I don't know that this is very widely used in the industry right now so most people look at this number here uh
without sparcity and you'll notice that we could have got even more here but this is int 8 and int 8 is used for
inference not for training uh because int 8 has a um it basically has um
uniform spacing um and uh we actually require a float so that we get a better match to
the uh normal distributions that occur during training of neural networks where
both activations and weights are distributed as a normal distribution and so uh floating points are really
important to to match that uh representation so we're not typically using int 8 uh for training but we are
using it for inference and if we bring down the Precision we can get a lot more Terra flops out of the tensor course
available in the gpus we'll talk about that in a second but in addition to that if all of these numbers have fewer bits
of representation it's going to be much easier to move them around and that's where we start to get into the memory
bandwidth and the memory of the model so not only do we have a finite capacity of the number of bits that our GPU can
store but in addition to that there's a speed with which you can access this memory um and you have a certain memory
bandwidth it's a very precious resource and in fact many of the deep learning uh
work workloads for training are memory bound and what that means is actually that the tensor cores that do all these
extremely fast multiplications most of the time they're waiting around they're idle um because we can't feed them with
data fast enough we can't load the data fast enough from memory so typical utilizations of your Hardware if you're
getting 60% uh utilization you're actually doing extremely well um so half
of the time in a well-tuned application your tensor cores are not doing multiplies because the data is not
available so the memory bandwidth here is extremely important as well and if we come down in the Precision for all the
floats all the numbers weights and activations suddenly require less memory so we can store more and we can access
it faster so everything speeds up and it's amazing and now let's reap the benefits of it um and let's first look
at the tensor float 32 format okay so first of all what are tensor cores well tensor course tensor

## 让训练更快：GPU、混合精度和 1000ms

### 1. 确保训练正确并准备加速

在确保模型正确实现和数据加载器正常工作的基础上，接下来我们要做的就是大幅度加速训练过程，以便充分利用硬件的性能，确保训练效率。

首先，检查硬件配置是非常重要的。我的硬件配置如下：

* 我有 **8 个 NVIDIA A100 GPU**，每个 GPU 拥有 **80GB 内存**。这是非常强大的硬件，可以提供极高的计算性能。

### 2. 使用 Lambda Labs

我喜欢使用 **Lambda Labs** 提供的云计算服务，它允许我按小时租用带有 A100 GPU 的机器，非常适合深度学习开发。通过 Lambda Labs，我能够轻松连接到这些机器，并使用 VSCode 开发环境进行工作。

### 3. 默认的精度和浮点计算

当我运行训练时，默认情况下，所有的张量（如激活值和权重）都使用 **FP32（32 位浮点）** 精度。这意味着每个数字都使用 32 位表示，这在深度学习中非常常见。尽管这种精度可以保证计算的准确性，但它会消耗大量内存，尤其是在处理大型模型时。

### 4. 降低精度提高性能

对于深度学习来说，并不需要非常高的精度来进行训练。通过降低精度，可以显著提升计算性能，并减少内存消耗。NVIDIA 的 A100 GPU 支持更低精度的计算，如 **TF32** 和 **FP16**，可以带来巨大的性能提升：

* **TF32**：在精度降低的情况下，性能可以提升 **8 倍**，达到 160TeraFlops。
* **FP16（半精度浮点）** 或 **Bfloat16**：将性能提升 **16 倍**，达到 312TeraFlops。

通过降低精度，我们不仅能加速计算，还能有效节省内存带宽（memory bandwidth）和存储空间。深度学习中的计算任务往往是 **内存带宽限制** 的，即大部分时间，计算核心（tensor cores）并没有被充分利用，因为数据加载的速度跟不上计算速度。

### 5. 精度与内存带宽

内存带宽是非常宝贵的资源，很多深度学习工作负载的训练过程受到内存带宽的限制。为了提高效率，我们需要减少每个数据元素的存储空间和计算量，这样才能更快地从内存中加载数据并进行计算。降低精度能够显著减少每个张量占用的内存空间，进而提高内存带宽的利用率。

### 6. Tensor Cores

**Tensor Cores** 是专门用于高效矩阵运算的硬件单元，尤其在深度学习中，矩阵乘法是最常见的操作。Tensor Cores 在处理低精度浮点计算时非常高效，因此我们可以通过使用低精度格式（如 **FP16** 或 **TF32**）来加速计算。

### 总结

* 我们通过 **降低精度**（如使用 **FP16** 或 **TF32**），显著提高了 **GPU** 的计算性能，同时减少了内存的使用。
* **Tensor Cores** 的高效性使得在低精度下进行大规模计算变得更加高效。
* 降低精度不仅能提升计算速度，还能改善内存带宽的使用，避免内存瓶颈。

通过这种方式，我们可以更充分地利用硬件资源，显著加速训练过程。

---

## ✅ 总结

* **FP32**：最稳，最标准，但速度和显存开销大。
* **FP16**：快、省显存，但数值范围小，需要 AMP 技术。
* **TF32**：兼顾 FP32 的范围和 FP16 的速度，在新 GPU 上几乎替代 FP32 做训练。

---

要不要我再帮你讲一下 **AMP（自动混合精度训练）里 FP16 + FP32 是怎么配合工作的**？

```
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')
```

好问题 👍 你问的这句：

```python
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')
```

是 **PyTorch 1.12+** 新增的接口，用来控制 **矩阵乘法 (matmul, GEMM)** 时，
在 **支持 TensorFloat-32 (TF32)** 的 GPU（NVIDIA Ampere 架构 A100 / RTX30xx 及更新）上，
PyTorch 到底用 **FP32 计算** 还是 **TF32 计算**。

---

## 1. 背景：FP32 vs TF32

* **FP32**：精度高（7 位有效数字），但是速度慢。
* **TF32**：指数范围和 FP32 一样，但尾数精度只有 10bit（≈ FP16），所以有效数字 \~3 位；
  → **速度快很多（利用 Tensor Cores）**，精度够大多数深度学习任务用。

在 Ampere GPU 上，默认 PyTorch 会 **自动把 FP32 矩阵乘法用 TF32 执行**（除非关闭）。

---

## 2. 这个函数的作用

```python
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(precision)
```

其中 `precision` 可选值有：

* `'high'`  → **强制 FP32 精度**（不开 TF32，加速效果差，但结果和老版本完全一致）
* `'medium'` → **默认**（用 TF32 加速，但保持累加在 FP32，不容易崩精度）
* `'highest'` → 强制最精确实现（几乎不用 TF32/其他近似，最慢，主要用在需要严格数值一致性的场景，比如科学计算）

---

## 3. 示例

```python
import torch

# 默认 medium
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium')

# 改成 high，强制 FP32 精度
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')

# 改成最高精度（最慢）
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('highest')
```

---

## 4. 实际效果

* 如果你用的是 A100 / RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 之类的显卡：

  * `'medium'`：训练速度最快（用 TF32），精度对深度学习足够。
  * `'high'`：训练速度下降（FP32），结果和传统 FP32 完全一致。
  * `'highest'`：最慢，一般不用，除非做科学仿真。
* 如果你用的是旧 GPU（不支持 TF32），这个设置没啥影响。

---

## ✅ 总结

```python
torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('high')
```

的意思是：**在 FP32 矩阵乘法时，禁用 TF32 加速，强制用真正的 FP32 精度计算**。

* `'high'`：更精确（兼容旧结果），速度较慢
* `'medium'`：默认值，开启 TF32，速度快，精度足够
* `'highest'`：最精确（几乎不用近似），最慢

---

要不要我给你对比一下 **训练 GPT-2 用 TF32 vs FP32 的速度差异和精度影响**？

```
import code; code.interact(local=locals())
```

好问题 👍
这一句：

```python
import code; code.interact(local=locals())
```

其实就是在 Python 程序里 **启动一个交互式 REPL（类似 `python` 命令行环境）**，并且把当前的局部变量环境传进去。

---

## 1. `code.interact` 是什么？

* Python 标准库里有个 [`code`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html) 模块，提供了一个简单的交互式解释器接口。
* `code.interact()` 会打开一个交互式 shell，你可以在里面输入 Python 语句，就像在终端运行 `python` 一样。

---

## 2. `local=locals()` 的作用

* `locals()` 会返回当前作用域下的局部变量字典。
* 把它传给 `code.interact(local=locals())`，就能在交互环境里访问到你程序当前的变量。

比如：

```python
a = 10
b = 20

import code
code.interact(local=locals())
```

运行后会进入交互模式，你可以直接操作变量 `a` 和 `b`：

```
Python 3.11.9 (main, May  5 2024, 00:00:00) 
[GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> a
10
>>> b
20
>>> a + b
30
```

等于是把运行环境“冻结”，让你在那一刻打开一个 Python 控制台调试。

---

## 3. 典型用途

* **调试**：在某个地方插一个交互式 shell，检查变量值。
* **探索模型/数据**：比如在训练循环中间插入 `code.interact`，随时看模型权重、梯度。
* **临时替代 `pdb.set_trace()`**，但提供的是 REPL 而不是单步调试器。

---

## 4. 和 `pdb.set_trace()` 的区别

* `pdb.set_trace()` → 进入调试模式，可以单步执行、查看堆栈。
* `code.interact(local=locals())` → 进入交互模式，只能运行 Python 语句，不能单步走代码。

---

✅ **总结**
`import code; code.interact(local=locals())` 会启动一个 Python REPL，并带上当前作用域里的变量，方便你随时查看和操作。

要不要我帮你写一个 **在训练 GPT 时用 `code.interact` 临时检查 logits/梯度的例子**？

# 介绍一下 TFLOPS

好问题 👍

---

# 什么是 **TFLOPS**

**TFLOPS** 全称 **Tera Floating Point Operations Per Second**，意思是：
👉 **每秒钟能进行万亿次（10¹²）浮点运算** 的能力。

* **FLOPS**：Floating Point Operations Per Second，浮点运算次数/秒。
* **T**：Tera，代表 10¹²（1 万亿）。
* 所以 **1 TFLOPS = 1 × 10¹² 次浮点运算/秒**。

---

# 1. 为什么要看 FLOPS？

FLOPS 是衡量 **计算机/显卡/AI 芯片** 处理能力的常见指标，尤其在 **科学计算**、**深度学习训练**、**3D 图形渲染** 中非常重要，因为这些任务大量依赖浮点数计算。

比如：

* AI 训练中的矩阵乘法、卷积运算。
* 科学模拟中的物理/化学方程计算。
* 图形渲染中的光照、物理模拟。

---

# 2. 如何计算理论 TFLOPS（以 GPU 为例）

计算公式常见写法：

$$
\text{TFLOPS} = \frac{\text{CUDA cores} \times \text{时钟频率 (GHz)} \times \text{每周期FLOP数}}{10^{12}}
$$

举个例子：
假设某 GPU 有 **5000 个 CUDA Core**，频率 **1.5 GHz**，每个核心 **每周期执行 2 次浮点运算 (FMA)**：

$$
\text{FLOPS} = 5000 \times 1.5 \times 10^9 \times 2 = 15 \times 10^{12} = 15 \, \text{TFLOPS}
$$

---

# 3. 理论 TFLOPS vs 实际性能

* **理论 TFLOPS**：通过硬件规格算出来的峰值（厂家宣传的数字）。
* **实际 TFLOPS**：取决于任务、内存带宽、指令调度等，通常达不到理论值。

  > 比如 GPU 内存不足或 I/O 瓶颈，TFLOPS 可能只跑到 30–60%。

---

# 4. 单位对比

* **GFLOPS**：Giga FLOPS = 10⁹ 次运算/秒（十亿）。
* **TFLOPS**：Tera FLOPS = 10¹² 次运算/秒（万亿）。
* **PFLOPS**：Peta FLOPS = 10¹⁵ 次运算/秒（千万亿，超算常用）。
* **EFLOPS**：Exa FLOPS = 10¹⁸ 次运算/秒（百亿亿，目前顶级超算目标）。

---

# 5. 举例

* **NVIDIA RTX 3090**：理论 FP32 算力 ≈ **35.6 TFLOPS**。
* **NVIDIA A100 (80GB)**：理论 FP32 ≈ **19.5 TFLOPS**，Tensor Core 用 FP16/TF32 算力能超过 **300 TFLOPS**。
* **顶级超算（Frontier，美国）**：超过 **1 EFLOPS**（百亿亿次）。

---

✅ **一句话总结**
TFLOPS 是衡量处理器/显卡计算能力的指标，表示 **每秒钟能执行多少万亿次浮点运算**。它是 AI 训练、科学计算、图形渲染性能对比的重要参数。

---

要不要我给你做一张表，对比一下 **常见 GPU 的 TFLOPS（FP32/FP16/TF32）**？

# Tensor Cores, timing the code, TF32 precision, 333ms

core is just an instruction in the a100 architecture right so so what it does is
it does basically a little 4x4 Matrix multiply so uh this is just matrix
multiplication here of 4x4 matrices and there are multiple configurations as to
what Precision any of these matrices are it in what Precision the internal accumulate happens and then what is the
output Precision input precisions Etc so there's a few switches but it's basically a 4x4 multiply and then
anytime we have any operations that require Magic multiplication uh they get broken up into these into this
instruction of little 4x4 multiply and so everything gets broken up into this instruction because it's the fastest way
to multiply matrices and it turns out that most of the computational work that we're doing up above uh all of it really
is matrix multiplication most of the work computationally happens in the linear layers um linear linear Etc
there's a few things sandwiched in between so there's some additions in residuals there's some G nonlinearities
there's some layer Norms Etc but if you just time them you'll see that these are nothing like basically the in
Transformer is just a bunch of Matrix multiplications really um and especially
at this small scale 124 million parameter model actually the biggest matrix multiplication by far is the
classifier layer at the top that is a massive Matrix multiply of going from 768 to
50257 and that Matrix multiply dominates anything else that happens in that Network roughly speaking so it's Matrix
multiplies that become a lot faster which are hidden inside our linear layers and they're accelerated through
tensor course now the best reference I would say for tensor course is basically just go to the um a 100 architecture
white paper and then it's pretty detailed and but I think people it's
like relatively readable mostly if you half understand what's happening um so
figure 9 tensor float 32 so this is the explanation basically for tf32 and what happens here and you
see that there's many configuration options here available so the input operands and what precisions are they in
the accumulator and um what um basically the um the internal representation
within the instruction when you do the accumulate of this matrix multiplication so the intermediate plus
equals um of the intermediate little vector multiplies here that all happens in
fp32 and then uh this is an aex improvement as I mentioned to the Ops that we get so tf32 specifically we're
looking at this row here and the way this works is
um normally fp32 has 32 bits tf32 is the exact same bits we have one
sign bit we have eight exponent bits except the mantisa bits get cropped in
the float and so basically um we end up with just 19 bits instead of 32 bits
because the last 133 bits get truncated they get dropped um and all this is
internal to the instruction so none of it is visible to anything in our pytorch uh none of our pytorch code will change
all of the numbers will look identical it's just that when you call the tensor core um instruction internally in the
hardware it will crop out these 13 bits and that allows it to uh calculate this
little Matrix multiply significantly faster 8X faster now of course this speed up comes at a cost and the cost is
that we are reducing the Precision our accumulate is still an fp32 our output is fp32 our inputs are fp32 but
internally things get truncated in the operand to perform the operation faster and so our results are starting to be a
bit more approximate but empirically when you actually train with this you basically can't tell the difference
so the reason I like tf32 is because if you can tolerate a little bit of a Precision fudge um then this is free
like none of your codes sees this it's fully internal to the operation and the operation to you just go 8X faster and
it's a bit more approximate and so it's a pretty sweet spot I would say in optimization and uh let's see what that
looks like first so I've set up our Cod to just time the uh iterations so import
time I changed the hyper parameters so that we have something a bit more that reflects uh kind of workload that we
want to run uh because we want to do a fairly large run at the end of this so let's use batch size 16 and let's now
use the actual gpt2 um maximum sequence length of 10,24 tokens uh so this is the
configuration and then for 50 iterations I'm just doing something very lazy here
I'm doing time. time to get the current time and then this is the optimization Loop and now I want to time how long
this takes now one issue with working with gpus is that as your
CPU um when your CPU runs it's just scheduling work on GPU it's ordering
some work right and so it send a request and then it continues running and so we
can actually it can happen sometimes that we sort of um speed through this and we queue up a lot of kernels to run
on the GPU and then the CPU sort of like gets here and takes time at time but actually the GPU is still running
because it takes it time to actually work through the work that was scheduled to run and so you're just building up a
queue for the GPU and so actually if you need to you want to wait toat data synchronize and this will wait for the
GPU to finish all the work that was scheduled to run up above here and then
we can actually take the time so basically we're waiting for the GPU to stop this iteration take time and then
we're going to just print it so so here I'm going to run the training Loop and here on the right I'm watching
Nvidia SMI so we start off at zero um we're not using the GPU and then by
default P will use gpu0 so we see that it gets filled up and we're using 35 GB
out of 80 gabt available and then here on the left we see that because we've cranked up the
batch size now it's only 20 batches to do a single Epoch on our tiny Shakespeare
and we see that we're seeing roughly a th000 milliseconds per iteration here right
so the first iteration sometimes is slower and that's because pytorch might be doing a lot of initializations here
on the very first iteration and so it's probably initializing all these uh tensors and buffers to hold all the
gradients and I'm not 100% sure all the work that happens here but uh this could be a slower iteration when you're timing
your logic you always want to be careful with that but basically we're seeing a th000 milliseconds per iteration
um and so this will run for roughly 50 seconds as we have it right now so
that's our Baseline in flo 32 one more thing I wanted to mention is that if
this doesn't fit into your GPU and you're getting out of memory errors then start decreasing your batch size until
things fit so instead of 16 try eight or four or whatever you need to fit um the
batch into your GPU and if you have a bigger GPU you can actually potentially get away with 32 and so on uh by default
you want to basically max out has Max Max out the batch size that fits on your GPU and you want to keep it nice numbers
so use numbers that have lots of powers of two in them so 16 is a good number 8
24 32 48 These are nice numbers but don't use something like 17 uh because
that will run very inefficiently on a GPU uh and we're going to see that a bit later as well so for now let's just
stick with 16124 and uh the one thing that I added also here and I ran it again is I'm
calculating a tokens per second throughput during training because we might end up changing the
backat size around over time but tokens per second is the objective measure that we actually really care about how many
tokens of data are we training on and what is the throughput of tokens that we're getting in our optimization so
right now we're processing and training on 163,000 tokens per second roughly and
that's a bit more objective metric okay so let's now enable tf32 now
luckily pytorch makes this fairly easy for us and uh to enable tf32 you just
need to do a single line and is this and when we go to the py documentation here
for this function basically this tells pych what kind of kernels to run and by
default I believe it is highest highest Precision for mat M and that means that
everything happens in float 32 just like it did before but if we set it to high as we do right now Matrix
multiplications will not use tensor flow 32 when it's available my GPU is a100 so it's an
ampere series and therefore tf32 is available if you have an older GPU this
might not be available for you but for my GPU it's available and so what I expect P to do is that every single
place where we see an nn. linear inside there there's a matrix multiplication and I expect that matrix multiplication
now to be um running on tensor course utilizing the TF 32%
so this is the single line of change that is I believe necessary and let's rerun this now we saw that um in terms
of the throughput that is promised to us we're supposed to be getting 8X roughly
so let's see what happens and that 8X came from here right
um 8X and it also came from looking at it um here 156 T flops instead of of
19.5 okay so what actually happened uh so we're seeing that our throughput
roughly 3x not aex so we are going we're
from 1,000 milliseconds we're going down to 300 milliseconds and our throughput is now about 50,000 tokens per second so
we have a roughly 3x instead of 8X so what happened and basically What's Happening Here is again a lot of these
workloads are memory bound and so even though the tf32 offers in principle a lot faster
throughput all of these numbers everywhere are still float 32s and it's float 32 numbers that are being shipped
all over the place through the memory system and is just costing us way too much time to shuttle around all this
data and so even though we've made the multiply itself much faster uh we are memory bound and we're not actually
seeing the full benefit uh that would come from uh this napkin math here uh
that said we are getting one a 3X faster throughput and this is free um single
line of code in P torch all your variables are still float 32 everywhere it just runs faster and it's slightly
more approximate but we're not going to notice it basically uh so that's
tf32 okay so let's now continue so we've exercised this row and um we saw that we

当然可以，以下是这段内容的中文解释：

## 加速训练（二）：Tensor Cores、代码计时、TF32 精度、333 毫秒每步

### 1. 什么是 Tensor Cores？

在 A100 GPU 架构中，**Tensor Core 是一种特殊的硬件指令**，用于加速 **小规模矩阵乘法**（如 4x4 矩阵的乘法）。虽然它是一个“指令”，但本质上可以理解为专用硬件模块，执行大量高效的矩阵乘法操作。

在 Transformer 中，大部分计算量都集中在 **线性层（linear layers）** 中，这些本质上就是矩阵乘法。例如：

* 多头注意力的线性映射
* MLP（前馈网络）
* 最顶层的输出分类器（从隐藏层维度 768 变换到词表维度 50257）
  这些都可以拆解成若干个小型矩阵乘法，因此 Tensor Core 可以大大加速这些操作。

### 2. 什么是 TF32？

**TF32（TensorFloat-32）** 是一种 NVIDIA 针对深度学习优化的浮点格式，在 A100 等新一代 GPU 上支持。

它的主要特点是：

* 仍然使用 32 位浮点表示，但 **精度更低**

  * 指数位与 FP32 一样（8 位）
  * 有效位（mantissa）被裁剪，只保留了 10 位（总共大约 19 位信息）
* 对用户代码是完全透明的，PyTorch 中变量仍然是 float32
* 乘法使用 TF32，**累加和输出仍然是 FP32**

> 这样能在几乎无损精度的情况下，获得 **高达 8 倍的速度提升**

### 3. 如何启用 TF32？

PyTorch 中只需一句代码即可启用 TF32：

```python
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
```

这会让 `torch.matmul()` 或 `nn.Linear()` 背后的矩阵乘法默认使用 TF32 模式（如果 GPU 支持，例如 A100）。

### 4. 实测效果：从 1000ms → 333ms

作者设置了如下超参数：

* `batch_size = 16`
* `sequence_length = 1024`
* 使用了时间模块 `time.time()` 对训练循环计时

为了确保 GPU 的操作完成后才计时，他使用了：

```python
torch.cuda.synchronize()
```

这个函数确保 CPU 等待 GPU 上的操作真正执行完再继续，以避免时间统计被“提前”。

**在启用 TF32 之前：**

* 每次训练迭代时间大约是 **1000ms**
* 吞吐量约为 **16 万 tokens / 秒**

**启用 TF32 后：**

* 每次训练迭代时间降到 **大约 333ms**
* 吞吐量上升到 **50 万 tokens / 秒**
* 实际加速为 **约 3 倍**

虽然理论上 TF32 提供 **8 倍** 的计算加速，但没有完全体现出来。这是因为：

> **训练过程不是计算瓶颈，而是**“**内存带宽瓶颈**”：
>
> * 即：GPU 的计算核心（Tensor Core）在等待数据从内存加载，而不是在忙于乘法运算
> * 数据依然是 float32 类型，占用大量内存和带宽

### 5. 小贴士

* 如果你遇到 **显存不足** 错误（Out of Memory），请减小 `batch_size`
* 选择 `batch_size` 时尽量使用 **2 的倍数**（如 8、16、32），这些在 GPU 上运行更高效
* 吞吐量（tokens/sec）是最客观的性能指标，用于衡量训练是否加快

---

### 总结

* **Tensor Core + TF32** 是现代 NVIDIA GPU 提供的免费加速神器
* 在 PyTorch 中只需 1 行代码就能启用，大约能获得 **3 倍以上** 的速度提升
* 完全向后兼容，训练过程无感知，代码不需要大改
* 实际效果受限于 **内存带宽**，但已是非常实用的优化手段

---

接下来，作者会继续讲解如何使用 **FP16（混合精度）** 进一步提速。如果你想继续了解，请告诉我！

torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(precision)[source]
Sets the internal precision of float32 matrix multiplications.

Running float32 matrix multiplications in lower precision may significantly increase performance, and in some programs the loss of precision has a negligible impact.

Supports three settings:

“highest”, float32 matrix multiplications use the float32 datatype (24 mantissa bits with 23 bits explicitly stored) for internal computations.

“high”, float32 matrix multiplications either use the TensorFloat32 datatype (10 mantissa bits explicitly stored) or treat each float32 number as the sum of two bfloat16 numbers (approximately 16 mantissa bits with 14 bits explicitly stored), if the appropriate fast matrix multiplication algorithms are available. Otherwise float32 matrix multiplications are computed as if the precision is “highest”. See below for more information on the bfloat16 approach.

“medium”, float32 matrix multiplications use the bfloat16 datatype (8 mantissa bits with 7 bits explicitly stored) for internal computations, if a fast matrix multiplication algorithm using that datatype internally is available. Otherwise float32 matrix multiplications are computed as if the precision is “high”.

When using “high” precision, float32 multiplications may use a bfloat16-based algorithm that is more complicated than simply truncating to some smaller number mantissa bits (e.g. 10 for TensorFloat32, 7 for bfloat16 explicitly stored). Refer to [Henry2019] for a complete description of this algorithm. To briefly explain here, the first step is to realize that we can perfectly encode a single float32 number as the sum of three bfloat16 numbers (because float32 has 23 mantissa bits while bfloat16 has 7 explicitly stored, and both have the same number of exponent bits). This means that the product of two float32 numbers can be exactly given by the sum of nine products of bfloat16 numbers. We can then trade accuracy for speed by dropping some of these products. The “high” precision algorithm specifically keeps only the three most significant products, which conveniently excludes all of the products involving the last 8 mantissa bits of either input. This means that we can represent our inputs as the sum of two bfloat16 numbers rather than three. Because bfloat16 fused-multiply-add (FMA) instructions are typically >10x faster than float32 ones, it’s faster to do three multiplications and 2 additions with bfloat16 precision than it is to do a single multiplication with float32 precision.

解释一下

好的，我来帮你逐条解释一下 **`torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(precision)`** 的作用和原理。

---

## 🔹 这个函数做什么？

在 PyTorch 中，`torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(precision)` 用来设置 **float32 矩阵乘法的内部计算精度**。

有时候我们并不需要满精度的 FP32（23 位尾数位），使用稍低精度的数据格式（如 TensorFloat32 或 bfloat16）可以 **显著加速矩阵乘法**，而损失的精度在很多场景下影响并不大（例如深度学习训练/推理）。

---

## 🔹 支持的三种模式

1. **"highest"**

   * 强制使用 **float32（标准 23 位尾数位）** 来计算矩阵乘法。
   * 这是传统的最高精度 FP32 算法，速度较慢但数值最准确。

2. **"high"**

   * 尝试使用 **TensorFloat32 (TF32)** 或 **bfloat16 分解算法** 来加速计算。
   * **TensorFloat32 (TF32)**：只有 10 位有效尾数位（比 FP32 少，但比 bfloat16 多），是 NVIDIA Ampere GPU 的特性。
   * **bfloat16 分解算法**：把一个 FP32 数字近似表示为 **两个 bfloat16 数字的和**（而不是直接截断），这样能保留大约 16 位精度。
   * 如果硬件/算法不支持 TF32 或 bfloat16，就会回退到 `"highest"` 模式。

3. **"medium"**

   * 尝试直接使用 **bfloat16（7 位尾数位）** 做矩阵乘法。
   * 精度更低，但速度最快。
   * 如果不支持，就会回退到 `"high"`。

---

## 🔹 为什么 "high" 模式更巧妙？

这里引用了 \[Henry2019] 的方法，核心思想是：

* **float32 有 23 位尾数位**，而 **bfloat16 只有 7 位尾数位**。
* 你可以用 **3 个 bfloat16 数字的和** 来完美表示一个 float32。

  * 比如：FP32 = bf16\_1 + bf16\_2 + bf16\_3
* 两个 float32 相乘 = 9 个 bfloat16 相乘（因为每一项展开）。

为了加速，PyTorch 选择只保留其中最重要的 3 个乘积（舍弃涉及低 8 位尾数的部分）。这样就相当于把 FP32 近似为 **两个 bfloat16 的和**，比单纯截断更精确。

➡️ 这样做的结果：

* **精度损失：** 忽略了最后 8 位尾数。
* **性能提升：** bfloat16 乘加（FMA）在硬件上比 FP32 乘法 **快 10 倍以上**。
* **整体效果：** 只需要 3 次 bfloat16 乘法 + 2 次加法，就能近似 1 次 FP32 乘法，速度远超 FP32。

---

## 🔹 直观总结

* `"highest"` → 100% 精度，最慢。
* `"high"` → 舍弃部分尾数位（最后 ~~8 位），精度大约保留到 FP16~~FP32 之间，速度大幅提升。
* `"medium"` → 直接用 bfloat16 算，精度最低，但速度最快。

在深度学习训练中，一般使用 `"high"` 或 `"medium"` 足够，因为神经网络对少量数值噪声不敏感，还可能因随机性带来类似正则化的效果。

---

要不要我帮你画一个 **精度 vs 性能对比表**，直观展示 `"highest" / "high" / "medium"` 三种模式的数值精度和运行速度差异？



# float16, gradient scalers, bfloat16, 300ms

can crop out some of the Precision inside the operation itself but we saw that we're still memory bound we're
still moving around all these floats right otherwise and we're paying that cost because of this so let's now
decrease the amount of stuff that we're going to be moving around and we're going to do that by dropping down to B
float 16 so we're only going to be maintaining 16 bits per float and we're
going to use the B flat 16 and I'll explain in a bit uh fp16 difference and uh we're going to be in this row so when
we go back to the documentation here for the a 100 um we see here the precisions that
are are available and this is the original fp32 the tf32 crops out the
Precision and then here in bf16 you see that it is very similar to
tf32 but it's even more aggressive in cropping off of the Precision the
mantisa of this float so the important thing with B float 16 is that the exponent bits and the sign bit of course
remain unchanged so if you're familiar with your float numbers and I think this should should probably be an entire
video by itself the exponent sets the range that you can represent of your numbers and the
Precision is how much Precision you have for your numbers and so the range of
numbers is identical but we can we have fewer possibilities within that range
because we are truncating the Mena so we have less Precision in that range what that means is that things are
actually fairly nice because we have the original range of numbers that are representable in float but we just have
less Precision for it and the difference with fp16 is that they actually touch
and change the range so fp16 cannot represent the full range of fp32 it has
a reduced range and that's where you start to actually run into issues because now you need uh these gradient
scalers and things like that and I'm not going to go into the detail of that in this video because that's a whole video
by itself but fb16 actually historically came first that was available in the Volta series before Amper and so fp16
came first and everyone started to train in fp16 but everyone had to use all these gradient scaling operations which
are kind of annoying and it's an additional source of state and complexity and the reason for that was
because the exponent range was reduced in fp16 so that's the i e fp16 spec and
then they came out with bf16 and the Ampere and they made it much simpler because we're just truncating manessa we
have the exact same range and we do not need gradient scalers so everything is much much simpler now when we do use
bf16 though we are impacting the numbers that we might be seeing in our pytorch
code these this change is not just local to the operation itself so let's see how
that works um there's some documentation here that
so I think this is probably the best best page to explain how to use mixed Precision in pytorch um because there
are many other tutorials and so on even within pitor documentation that are a lot more confusing and so I recommend
specifically this one because there's five other copies that I would not recommend and then when we come
here ignore everything about everything ignore everything about gradient scalers and only look at torch.
AutoCast and basically also this comes to a single line of code at the end so this is the context manager that we
want and we want to use that in our Network when you click into the torch.
AutoCast autocasting it has a few more uh a bit more guideline for you so it's
telling you do not call B flat 16 on any of your tensors just use AutoCast and
only surround the uh forward pass of the model and the loss calculation and that's the only two things that you
should be surrounding leave the backward and the optimizer step alone so that's the guidance that comes from the P team
so we're going to follow that guidance and for us because the L calculation is inside of the model forward pass for us
we are going to be doing this and then we don't want to be using torch Flo 16 because if we do that we
need to start using gradient scalers as well so we are going to be using B float 16 this is only possible to do an ampere
uh but this means that the changes are extremely minimal like basically just this one line of
code um let me first break in to here before we actually run this
so right after logits I'd like to show you that different from the tf32 that we
saw this is actually going to impact our tensors so this Lis tensor if we now look at
this and we look at the dtype we suddenly see that this is now B float 16 uh it's not float 32 anymore so our
activations have been changed the activations tensor is now B FL 16 but not everything has changed so model.
Transformer wte uh this is the weight uh token
embedding table it has a weight inside it and the dtype of this weight this
parameter is still torch float 32 so our parameters seem to still be in float 32
but our activations the loits are now in P 16 so clearly this is why we get the
mixed Precision some things pytorch is keeping inlow 32 some things pytorch is
converting to lower Precision um and what gets converted at what point is not
super clear I remember scrolling down is it
here okay I can't find it I I thought it was here okay there we
go so there are a few docks on when you're using this AutoCast what gets
converted to B FL 16 and and when so for example only these Matrix multiply like
operations get converted to float 16 but a lot of operations remain in float 32 so in particular a lot of normalizations
like layer norms and things like that not all of those layers might be converted um so only some layers
selectively would be running B flat 16 but things like softmax uh layer Norms
uh log um log soft Max so loss function calculations a lot of those things might
remain in float 32 because they are more susceptible to Precision changes major multiplies are fairly um
robust to Precision changes uh so some parts of the network are um impacted
more or less by the Precision change um so basically only some parts
of the of the model are running in reduced Precision let's take it for a spin and let's actually see what kind of
improvement we achieve
here okay so we used to be 333 milliseconds we're now 300
and we used to be somewhere around 50,000 tokens per second we're now at 55 so we're definitely running faster but
maybe not a lot faster and that's because there are still many many bottlenecks in our gbt2 we're just
getting started but we have dropped down the precision as far as we can with my current GPU which is a100 we're using
pytorch AutoCast unfortunately I don't actually exactly know what pytorch AutoCast do uh does I don't actually
know exactly what's in B flat 16 what's in float 32 we could go in and we could start to scrutinize it um but these are the kinds
of rules that pytorch has internally and unfortunately they don't documented very well uh so we're not going to go into
that into in too much detail but for now we are training in B flow 16 we do not need a gradient scaler and the reason
things are running faster is because um we are able to run tensor course in B FL
16 now that means we are in this row but uh we are also paying in Precision for
this uh so um we expect slightly less accurate results with respect to the original fp32 but empirically in many
cases this is a worth it uh kind of tradeoff because it allows you to run faster and you could for example train
longer and make up for the uh for that Precision decrease so um that's b46 for

当然可以，以下是关于 **BFloat16、混合精度训练、以及 PyTorch 自动转换机制（AutoCast）** 的中文解释：

## 加速训练（三）：使用 Float16 / BFloat16，混合精度，300 毫秒每步

### 🧠 背景：我们要解决的问题

在上一节我们使用了 **TF32**，虽然得到了约 3 倍提速，但仍然 **存在内存带宽瓶颈** —— 也就是说，我们虽然让计算更快了，但传输这些 **float32 数值** 仍然很慢，占据了大量内存带宽。

接下来我们希望解决这个问题的方法是：
➡️ **进一步减少内存中每个数值的大小** —— 把 32 位的 float 换成 16 位。

---

## 🎯 两种 16 位浮点格式的区别：`fp16` vs `bfloat16`

| 特性           | `fp16` (float16) | `bfloat16` (Brain float 16) |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| 精度（mantissa） | 高（10 位）          | 低（7 位）                      |
| 范围（exponent） | 小（5 位）           | 大（8 位，和 float32 一样）         |
| 是否需要梯度缩放器    | ✅ 需要             | ❌ 不需要                       |
| 是否更安全稳定      | ❌ 容易爆炸/消失        | ✅ 和 float32 范围一致            |
| 推荐使用场景       | 旧 GPU（Volta）     | 新 GPU（Ampere，如 A100）        |

> 📌 总结：**`bfloat16` 是比 `fp16` 更安全、可替代的混合精度方案，兼容性和稳定性都更好。**

---

## ⚙️ 在 PyTorch 中启用 `bfloat16` 的方法：使用 `autocast`

PyTorch 提供了一个自动混合精度训练工具 —— `torch.autocast`
使用方法如下：

```python
with torch.autocast(device_type='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16):
    logits, loss = model(x, y)
```

* 这段代码只影响 **模型前向传播（forward）和 loss 计算**
* **不影响反向传播（backward）和优化器步骤（optimizer.step）**
* 不需要使用 `gradient scaler`

### 为什么 `autocast` 很棒？

* PyTorch 会 **自动决定哪些操作降精度**（比如矩阵乘法）
* 更敏感的操作（如 softmax、layernorm、log）会保留在 float32 精度下
* 只需一行代码 ✅
* 无需人为干预，自动选择安全高效的执行方式 ✅

---

## 👀 查看实际效果

在使用 `autocast` + `bfloat16` 后：

* logits 的精度从 float32 → bfloat16 ✅
* 模型的参数仍然保持在 float32（这是 PyTorch 默认行为）✅
* 所以这就是 **“混合精度”**：激活值低精度，参数高精度

---

## 📊 性能表现

* 启用 `bfloat16` 后，单次训练迭代从 **333ms → 300ms**
* 吞吐量从 **每秒 50,000 tokens → 55,000 tokens**
* 提升不是特别大，因为：

  * 目前模型依然存在内存带宽瓶颈
  * GPT2 模型还未深度优化

但：

* 这是在不引入额外复杂度的前提下获得的 **免费提速**
* 同时节省了大量显存

# torch.compile, Python overhead, kernel fusion, 130ms

now okay so as we can see we are currently at about 300 milliseconds uh per iteration and we're now going to
reach for some really heavy weapons in the pie torch Arsenal and in particular we're going to introduce torch. compile
so torch. compile is really quite incredible infrastructure from the pytorch team and it's basically a
compiler for neural networks like it's almost like GCC for CN C++ code this is
just this GCC of neural nuts so came out a while ago and extremely simple to use
um the way to use torch compile is to do this it's a single line of code to compile your model and return it now
this line of code will cost you compilation time but as you might guess it's going to make the code a lot faster
so let's actually run that because this will take some time to run but currently remember we're at 300 milliseconds and
we'll see what happens now while this is running I'd like to explain a little bit of what torch. compile does under the
hood uh so feel free to read this page of P torch but basically there's no real
good reason for you to not use torch compile in your pie torch I kind of feel like you should be using almost by
default if you're not uh unless you're debugging and you want your code to run really fast and there's one line here in
torch compile that I found that actually kind of like gets to why this is faster speed up mainly comes from reducing
python overhead and GPU read wrs so let me unpack that a little bit um okay here
we are okay so we went from 300 milliseconds we're now running at 129
milliseconds so this is uh 300 129 about 2.3x Improvement from a single line of
code in py torch uh so quite incredible so what is happening what's happening under the hood well when you pass the
model to torch compile what we have here in this NN module this is really just the
algorithmic description of what we'd like to happen in our Network and torch
compile will analyze the entire thing and it will look at what operations You' like to use and with the benefit of
knowing exactly what's going to happen it doesn't have to run in What's called the e mode it doesn't have to just kind
of like go layer by layer like the python interpreter normally would start
at the forward and the python interpreter will go okay let's do this operation and then
let's do that operation and it kind of materializes all the operations as it goes through uh so these um calculations
are dispatched and run in this order and the python interpreter and this code doesn't know what kind of operations are
going to happen later but torch compile sees your entire code at the same time and it's able to know what operations
you intend to run and it will kind of optimize that process the first thing it will do is will it will take out the
python interpreter from the forward pass entirely and it will kind of compile this entire neural net as a single
object with no python interpreter involved so it knows exactly what's going to run and we'll just run that and
it's all going to be running in efficient code uh the second thing that happens is
uh this read write that they mentioned very briefly so a good example of that I think is the G nonlinearity that we've
been looking at so here we use the n and G now this here is me uh basically just
breaking up the inang Galu uh which you remember has this formula so this here
is the equivalent implementation to what's happening inside g algorithmic l it's identical Now by default if uh we just
we using this instead of ending. G here what would happen without torch compile
well the python interpreter would make its way here and then it would be okay well there's an input well let me first
let me raise this input to the third power and it's going to dispatch a kernel that takes your input and raises
it to the third power and that kernel will run and when this kernel runs what
ends up happening is this input is stored in the memory of the GPU so here's a helpful example of the layout
of what's happening right you have your CPU this is in every single computer there's a few cores in there and you
have your uh Ram uh your memory and the CPU can talk to the memory and this is
all well known but now we've added the GPU and the GPU is a slightly different architecture of course they can
communicate and it's different in that it's got a lot more course than a CPU
all of those cores are individually a lot simpler too but it also has memory right this high bandwidth memory I'm
sorry if I'm botching it hbm I don't even know what that stands for I'm just realizing that
but uh this is the memory and it's very equivalent to uh RAM basically in the
computer and what's happening is that input is living in the memory and when you do input
cubed this has to travel to the GPU to the course and to all the caches and
registers on the actual chip of this GPU and it has to calculate the all the
elements to the third and then it saves the result back to the memory and it's this uh travel time that actually causes
a lot of issues so here remember this memory bandwidth we can communicate
about 2 terabytes per second which is a lot but also we have to Traverse this
link and it's very slow so here on the GPU we're on chip and everything is super fast within the chip but going to
the memory is extremely expensive takes extremely long amount of time and so we load the input do the calculations and
load back the output and this round trip takes a lot of time and now right after we do that we
multiply by this constant so what happens then is we dispatch another kernel and then the result travels back
all the elements get multiplied by a constant and then the results travel back to the memory and then we take the
result and we add back input and so this entire thing again travels to the GPU
adds the inputs and gets written back so we're making all these round trips from
the memory to actually where the comput happens because all the tensor cores and alus and everything like that is all
stored on the chip in the GPU so we're doing a ton of round trips and pytorch uh without using torch compile doesn't
know to optimize this because it doesn't know what kind of operations you're running later you're just telling it
raise the power to the third then do this then do that and it will just do that in that sequence but torch compile
sees your entire code it will come here and it will realize wait all of these are elementwise operations and actually
what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a single trip of input to the GPU then for every single element I'm going to do
all of these operations while that memory is on the GPU or chunks of it
rather and then I'm going to write back a single time so we're not going to have these round trips and that's one example
of what's called kernel fusion and is a major way in which everything is sped up so basically if you have your benefit of
onet and you know exactly what you're going to compute you can optimize your round trips to the memory and you're not
going to pay the the memory bandwidth cost and that's fundamentally what makes some of these operations a lot faster
and what they mean by read writes here so let me erase this because we are
not using it and yeah we should be using torch compile and our code is now
significantly faster and we're doing about 125,000 tokens per second but we still
have a long way to go before we move on I wanted to supplement the discussion a little bit with a few more figures uh
because this is a complic topic but it's worth understanding on a high level uh what's happening here and I could
probably spend an entire video of like two hours on this but just the preview of that basically so this chip here that
is uh the GPU this chip is where all the calculations happen mostly but this chip
also does have some memory in it but most of the memory by far is here in the
high bandwidth memory hbm and is connected they're connected um but these
are two separate chips basically now here this is a zoom in of kind of
this cartoon diagram of a GPU and what we're seeing here is number one you see
this hbm I I realize it's probably very small for you but on the sides here it says hbm and so that that's the links to
the hbm now the hbm is again off chip on the chip there are a large number of
these streaming multiprocessors uh every one of these is an SM there's 120 of them in total and
this is where the a lot of the calculations happen and this is a zoom in of a single individual as it has
these four quadrants and see for example tensor core this is where a lot of the Matrix multiply stuff happens but
there's all these other units to do all different kinds of calculations for fp64 fp32 and for integers and so on now so
we have all this uh logic here to do the calculations but in addition to that on the chip there is memory sprinkled
throughout the chip so L2 cache is some amount of memory that lives on the chip
and then on the SMS themselves there's L1 cache I realized it's probably very small for you but this blue bar is L1
and there's also registers um and so there is memory stored here but the way
this memory is stored is very different from the way memory is stored in hbm uh this is a very different implementation
uh using um just in terms of like what the Silicon looks like it's a very different
implementation um so here you would using transistors and capacitors and here it's a very different
implementation uh with SRAM and what that looks like but long story short is
um there is um memory inside the chip but it's not a lot of memory that's the
critical point so this is some C this is a example diagram of a slightly different GPU just like here where it
shows that for example typical numbers for CPU Dam memory which is this thing here you might have one tab of this
right but it would be extremely expensive to access especially for a GPU you have to go through the CPU here now
next we have the hbm so we have tens of gigabytes of hbm memory on a typical GPU here but it's as I mentioned very
expensive to access and then on the chip itself everything is extremely fast
within the chip but we only have couple 10 megabytes of memory collectively
throughout the Chip And so there's just not enough space because the memory is very expensive on the chip and so
there's not a lot of it but it is lightning fast to access in relative terms and so basically whenever we have
these kernels um the more accurate picture of what's Happening Here is that
we take these inputs which live by default on the global memory and now we need to perform some calculation so we
start streaming the data from the um Global memory to the uh chip we perform
the calculations on the chip and then stream it back and store it back to the global memory right and so if we are if
we don't have torch compile we are streaming the data through the chip doing the calculations and saving to the memory and we're doing those round trips
many many times but uh if it's torch compiled then we start streaming the memory as before
but then while we're on the chip we're we're we have a chunk of the uh data
that we're trying to process so that chunk now lives on the chip while it's on the chip it's extremely fast to
operate on so if we have kernel Fusion we can do all the operations right there in an element-wise fashion and those are
very cheap and then we do a single round trip back to the global memory so
operator Fusion basically allows you to keep your chunk of data on the Chip And do lots of calculations on it before you
write it back and that gives huge savings and that's why torch compile ends up being a lot faster or that's one
of the major reasons uh so again just a very brief intro to the memory hierarchy and
roughly what torch compile does for you now torch compile is amazing but there are operations torch compile will not

当然可以，下面是关于 **`torch.compile`、Python 开销、Kernel 融合、以及性能优化机制** 的中文解释。

---

## ✅ 使用 `torch.compile` 加速训练 —— 从 300ms 降到 130ms

---

### 📌 `torch.compile` 是什么？

PyTorch 团队推出的一个重量级功能，它本质上是：

> “神经网络的编译器”，就像 `gcc` 是 C/C++ 的编译器一样。

它可以：

* 移除 Python 解释器的运行时开销
* 自动 **合并多个 GPU kernel**（称为 *kernel fusion*）
* 优化读写操作，减少内存传输
* 让模型执行得更快，甚至**无需改动模型代码** ✅

---

### 🧪 如何使用？

仅需一行代码：

```python
model = torch.compile(model)
```

即可启用所有编译优化。

首次执行时会进行一次编译（耗时稍久），但之后所有 forward 都是高度优化的执行。

---

### ⏱️ 提速效果？

* 使用 `bfloat16` 前：**300ms/步**
* 加入 `torch.compile` 后：**129ms/步**
* 提速约 **2.3 倍**
* token 吞吐量从 **55,000 ➝ 125,000 tokens/sec**

这是在不改变模型结构、不重写代码的前提下获得的加速！

---

## 💡 为什么会加速？背后做了什么？

### ① 移除 Python 解释器的开销

在普通 PyTorch 模型中，每一层都会在 Python 解释器中逐条执行，比如：

```python
x = layer1(x)
x = layer2(x)
x = layer3(x)
```

每一层都要通过 Python 调度，这就有大量函数调用、对象管理、内存分配等开销。

而 `torch.compile` 会把这些操作**提前编译成一个整体执行的程序**，像一个「打包好的 forward 逻辑」，让 Python 不再干预，提高执行效率。

---

### ② Kernel Fusion（算子融合）

举例：

假设你写了如下操作：

```python
y = x ** 3 * 0.0447 + x
```

在普通 PyTorch 中，这三步是三次 **GPU kernel 调用**：

* 第一步 `x ** 3`：启动一个 kernel
* 第二步 `* 0.0447`：再来一次
* 第三步 `+ x`：再启动一次

每次都要：

* 把数据从 GPU 全局内存（HBM）读到芯片上
* 计算
* 写回内存（HBM）

这是很慢的，**内存带宽是最大瓶颈**。

> ⚠️ 即使你用了 A100 显卡，其 HBM 速度再快，也远不如芯片内部缓存（L1/L2）快！

#### ✅ `torch.compile` 能识别这些操作是「逐元素计算」（element-wise）

它会**把它们合并成一个 GPU kernel**，在数据还没写回之前，在芯片上连续做完所有操作，只写回一次。

这个叫 **算子融合（kernel fusion）**，大幅减少 GPU 内存读写时间，是性能提升的核心来源之一。

---

### ③ 避免不必要的读写

PyTorch 默认每个中间结果都写回内存。
但 `torch.compile` 能智能分析依赖关系，只保留必要的中间变量，大大减少临时内存分配和数据搬运。

---

## 🧠 GPU 内存结构回顾

* **HBM（High Bandwidth Memory）**：显卡主内存（几十 GB），但访问慢（尽管带宽高）
* **L2/L1 cache & registers**：芯片内存，速度极快，但容量极小（几 MB）
* **目标：尽量让数据在芯片内完成计算，只做一次 HBM 读写**

---

## ✅ 总结

| 优化          | torch.compile 带来的效果 |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Python 调度   | ✅ 移除                |
| kernel 调用次数 | ✅ 融合算子，合并 kernel    |
| 内存访问        | ✅ 减少读写，最大化使用芯片内缓存   |
| 性能提升        | ✅ 约 2～3 倍，仅一行代码     |

## 💬 小结

使用 `torch.compile` 是现代 PyTorch 模型训练的推荐实践之一：

* 几乎**零代码改动**
* 免费获得大幅加速
* 提高显存利用效率
* 结合 `autocast` + `bfloat16` 使用效果更佳

---

如果你还想继续了解：

* `torch.compile` 的运行机制
* 它用到的后端（如 TorchDynamo、AOTAutograd、Inductor）
* 或者多 GPU 分布式优化

我也可以进一步帮你解释。是否继续？

好问题 👍
你贴的这段内容本质上是在解释 **`torch.compile` 为什么能让 PyTorch 代码加速**。我来帮你拆开重点，逐层解释。

---

## 1. `torch.compile` 是什么

* PyTorch 2.0 引入的新特性。
* 作用：把模型的 **Python 代码（逐层 forward 运算）** 编译成一个优化后的计算图，然后执行。
* 类似于 **GCC 编译 C 程序** → 它把你的 PyTorch 代码变成更底层、更高效的执行代码。

一句话：**`torch.compile` 是 PyTorch 的 JIT 编译器，可以减少 Python 开销、融合算子（kernel fusion）、减少显存读写，从而显著加速模型运行。**

---

## 2. 为什么默认 PyTorch 慢

在没有 `torch.compile` 时：

1. Forward Pass 是 Python 解释器逐行执行：

   * `y = x ** 3` → 调用一个 CUDA kernel
   * `y = y * const` → 又调一个 CUDA kernel
   * `y = y + x` → 再调一个 CUDA kernel
     每一步都会涉及 GPU 内存 → GPU 核心 → GPU 内存的往返。

2. 这些「往返」很贵：

   * GPU 芯片内部（SM, Tensor Core）计算超快。
   * 但大多数数据存在于 **显存（HBM，高带宽内存）**。
   * 每次算完都要把结果写回显存，再从显存读出来 → 非常耗时。

---

## 3. `torch.compile` 做了什么优化

### (1) 去掉 Python 解释器开销

* 默认：Python 一行行调度运算，慢。
* `torch.compile`：把整个 forward 编译成优化过的图，直接运行 → 避免 Python overhead。

### (2) Kernel Fusion（算子融合）

* 默认：每个逐元素运算（+、-、\*、exp、relu 等）都触发一个 CUDA kernel。
* 问题：每个 kernel 都要「从显存 → 芯片 → 回写显存」一次。
* 优化：`torch.compile` 看到整个计算图后，把多个逐元素运算融合成 **一个 kernel**。

  * 内存只需要读一次、写一次。
  * 中间计算结果直接存在 **寄存器/L1/L2 cache**（在 GPU 芯片上），不用回到显存。

👉 这样就省下了大量显存带宽和延迟。

---

## 4. 实际效果

* 文中例子：

  * 未优化：**300ms/iteration**
  * 加上 `torch.compile`：**129ms/iteration**
  * 速度提升约 **2.3x**

* 一般训练中，提升幅度取决于：

  * 模型大小
  * 运算类型（算子多不多、能不能融合）
  * GPU 架构（Ampere/Hopper 上效果更好）

---

## 5. 背后的硬件原理（简化版）

GPU 内存层次：

1. **HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)**：几十 GB，存模型和数据，速度比 CPU RAM 快很多，但还是比芯片内部存取慢。
2. **L2/L1 Cache & Registers（在 GPU 芯片上）**：容量小（MB 级），但是非常快。

优化点：

* **默认模式**：每个运算都要把数据写回 HBM，再读出来。
* **Kernel Fusion**：数据加载到芯片 → 在寄存器里完成一系列计算 → 一次性写回。

---

## 6. 总结

* **为什么快？**

  1. 去掉 Python 解释器调度（减少 Python overhead）。
  2. Kernel Fusion（减少 GPU 显存的反复读写）。
* **收益**：

  * 更高吞吐（训练迭代时间减少）。
  * 显存带宽压力减小。
* **代价**：

  * 第一次编译需要额外时间（compilation overhead）。
  * 并不是所有算子都能优化。

✅ 一句话总结：
`torch.compile` 就是 PyTorch 的 **编译优化器**，通过消除 Python overhead 和 **kernel fusion**，避免 GPU 显存频繁读写，让训练/推理快了 2\~3 倍。

# flash attention, 96ms

find and an amazing example of that is Flash attention to which we turn next so
flash attention comes from this paper from uh Stanford in 2022 and it's this incredible algorithm
for performing attention so um and running it a lot faster so flash
attention will come here and we will take out these four lines and Flash attention implements
these four lines really really quickly and how does it do that well flash attention is a kernel Fusion operation
so you see here we have um in this diagram they're showing P torch and you
have these four operations uh they're including Dropout but we are not using Dropout here so we just have these four
lines of code here and instead of those we are fusing them into a single fused
kernel of flash attention so it's an it's a it's a kernel Fusion algorithm
but it's a kernel Fusion that torch compile cannot find and the reason that it cannot find it is
that it um requires an algorithmic rewrite of how attention is actually implemented here in this case and what's
remarkable about it is that uh flash attention actually if you just count the number of flops flash attention does
more flops than this attention here but flash attention is actually
significantly faster in fact they site 7. six times faster potentially and
that's because it is very mindful of the memory hierarchy as I described it just
now and so it's very mindful about what's in high bandwidth memory what's in the shared memory and it is very
careful with how it orchestrates the computation such that we have fewer reads and writes to the high bandwidth
memory and so even though we're doing more flops the expensive part is they load and store into hbm and that's what
they avoid and so in particular they do not ever materialize this end byend
attention Matrix this ATT here a flash attention is designed such that this
Matrix never gets materialized at any point and it never gets read or written to the hbm and this is a very large
Matrix right so um because this is where all the queries and keys interact and we're sort of getting
um for each head for each batch element we're getting a t BYT Matrix of
attention which is a Million numbers even for a single head at a single batch index at like so so basically this is a
ton of memory and and this is never materialized and the way that this is achieved is that basically the
fundamental algorithmic rewrite here relies on this online softmax trick which was proposed previously and I'll
show you the paper in a bit and the online softmax trick coming from a previous paper um shows how you can
incrementally evaluate a soft Max without having to sort of realize all of
the inputs to the softmax to do the normalization and you do that by having these intermediate variables M and L and
there's an update to them that allows you to evaluate the softmax in an online manner um now flash attention actually
so recently flash attention 2 came out as well so I have that paper up here as well uh that has additional gains to how
it calculates flash attention and the original paper that this is based on basically is this online normalizer
calculation for softmax and remarkably it came out of Nvidia and it came out of it like really early 2018 so this is 4
years before flash attention and this paper says that we propose a
way to compute the classical softmax with fewer memory accesses and hypothesize that this reduction in memory accesses should improve softmax
performance on actual hardware and so they are extremely correct in this
hypothesis but it's really fascinating to me that they're from Nvidia and that they had this realization but they
didn't actually take it to the actual flash attention that had to come four years later from Stanford so I don't
fully understand the historical how this happened historically um but they do basically propose this online update to
the softmax uh right here and this is fundamentally what they reuse here to
calculate the softmax in a streaming Manner and then they realize they can actually fuse all the other operations
with the online sofx calculation into a single fused kernel flash attention and that's what we are about to use so great
example I think of being aware of um memory hierarchy the fact that flops don't matter uh the entire memory access
pattern matters and that torch compile is amazing but there are many optimizations that are still available to us that potentially torch compile
cannot find maybe maybe one day it could but right now it seems like a lot to ask
so here's what we're going to do we're going to use Flash attention and the way to do that basically in pytorch is we
are going to comment out these four lines and we're going to replace them with a single line and here we are
calling this compound operation in pytorch called scale that product attention and uh pytorch will call flash
attention when you use it in this way I'm not actually 100% sure why torch
compile doesn't realize that these four lines should just call flash attention in this exact way we have to do it again
for it which in my opinion is a little bit odd but um here we are so you have
to use this compound up and uh let's wait for a few moments before torch comp
compile gets around to it and then let's remember that we achieved 6.05 661 I
have it here that's the loss we were expecting to see and we took 130 milliseconds uh before this change so
we're expecting to see the exact same result by iteration 49 but we expect to see faster runtime because Flash
attention is just a an algorithmic rewrite and it's a faster kernel but it doesn't actually change any of the computation and we should have the exact
same optimization so okay so we're a lot faster we're at about 95 milliseconds
and we achiev 6.58 okay so they're basically identical
up to a floating Point fudge Factor so it's the identical computation but it's
significantly faster going from 130 to roughly 90 96 and so this is um 96 divide
130ish so this is maybe 27 is% Improvement um so uh really interesting
and that is Flash retention okay we are now getting to one of my favorite optimizations and it is simultaneously

当然可以，以下是关于 **Flash Attention** 的中文解释，帮助你理解它是如何将训练速度从 **130ms 降到 96ms** 的：

---

## 🚀 Flash Attention —— 更快的注意力机制，加速至 96ms！

---

### 📌 Flash Attention 是什么？

Flash Attention 是 2022 年斯坦福大学提出的一种 **高效计算注意力（attention）** 的算法，它：

* **完全重写了原本的注意力计算方式**
* **将 4 个独立的操作合并成一个优化过的 GPU Kernel**
* **显著减少了内存读写，训练速度极大提升**

原始注意力实现有四步（简化版）：

```python
att = Q @ K.T
att = softmax(att)
att = att @ V
out = dropout(att)
```

Flash Attention 把这几步融合成一个 **统一的 GPU 内核操作（fused kernel）**，一次性完成，速度极快。

---

### 🧠 为什么能更快？

#### 原因一：**内存读写是最大瓶颈**

注意力中最费内存的是这一步：

```python
att = Q @ K.T
```

这个 `att` 是一个 `T × T` 的大矩阵（T 是序列长度，如 1024），它要存到 **GPU 的高带宽内存（HBM）** 中，这一步非常慢。

Flash Attention 通过 **算法重写**：

* 完全避免生成这个 `att` 矩阵
* 不再把它写入 / 读出 GPU 内存
* 而是在计算时 **在线（streaming）计算 softmax**
* 避免了最大内存开销，速度自然暴涨

---

#### 原因二：**在线 Softmax 计算（Online Softmax）**

Flash Attention 利用了一个 2018 年 NVIDIA 提出的技巧 —— **在线 softmax 归一化**：

* 原本的 softmax 需要等所有 `Q·K^T` 值算出来后，才能归一化
* 在线 softmax 可以在计算过程中维护中间变量 `M` 和 `L`，一步步计算 softmax，**无需一次性生成完整矩阵**
* 这样就能**边计算、边归一化、边生成结果**

这个 trick 是 Flash Attention 的核心算法突破点。

---

### 🧪 实际加速效果

* 使用 `torch.compile` 后是 **130ms / step**
* 使用 Flash Attention 后是 **96ms / step**
* 提速约 **26%**

并且 loss 几乎一致，计算结果等效，只是更快。

---

### ⚠️ 为什么 PyTorch 默认没用？

虽然 `torch.compile` 已经会自动融合很多操作，但 Flash Attention：

* 需要 **改写算法结构**，而不仅仅是融合现有 kernel
* PyTorch 默认的注意力写法用的是基本操作，无法自动识别可替换为 Flash Attention
* 你需要手动调用 PyTorch 提供的 **`scaled_dot_product_attention()`**：

```python
from torch.nn.functional import scaled_dot_product_attention

out = scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, is_causal=True)
```

这样才能调用 Flash Attention 核心优化逻辑。

## ✅ 总结：Flash Attention 的核心价值

| 特性        | 说明                     |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| 算法优化      | 采用在线 softmax，避免生成大矩阵   |
| Kernel 融合 | 将多步操作合成一个 GPU 内核       |
| 内存效率      | 极大减少高带宽内存（HBM）读写       |
| 实际提速      | 约 25-30%，训练更快，结果不变     |
| 适用范围      | 长序列、高 batch、GPT类模型尤为明显 |

如果你还想进一步了解 Flash Attention 的 CUDA 实现原理、FlashAttention-2 的新特性，或如何在自己模型中集成 Flash Attention，我也可以继续为你讲解。是否继续？

很好 👍
这一段是在解释 **FlashAttention** —— 一个专门为 **Transformer 的 Attention 计算** 设计的高效算法。它之所以快，原因和 `torch.compile` 类似：都是为了减少 **显存 (HBM) 读写**，但 FlashAttention 更进一步，直接对 **Attention 算法本身做了改写**。我给你分层拆解：

---

## 1. 回顾普通 Attention 计算

标准 **Scaled Dot-Product Attention** 有几个步骤：

1. 计算 **QKᵀ** （得到 Attention Scores，大小是 `seq_len × seq_len`）。
2. 对这个大矩阵做 **softmax**。
3. 对结果乘上 **V**。
4. 可能还有 **dropout**。

问题：

* 这个 `seq_len × seq_len` 矩阵（ATT）很大，尤其当 `seq_len=1024/2048` 时，每个 head 都要存几百万个浮点数。
* PyTorch 默认会 **显式 materialize（存储）这个矩阵到 HBM（显存）**。
* 结果是：大量 **显存 I/O**（读写），比算力更贵。

---

## 2. FlashAttention 的关键思想

### (1) 不存储大矩阵

* FlashAttention **从不显式存储** `QKᵀ` 这个 `seq_len × seq_len` 矩阵。
* 它用 **流式（online）softmax 技巧**：逐块计算 softmax，而不是一次性拿到完整的输入。

### (2) 算子融合 (kernel fusion)

* 把 **QKᵀ → softmax → 乘 V** 这些步骤 **融合成一个内核**。
* 数据只需 **一次读入、一次写回**，而不是每一步都回写显存。

### (3) 内存层次优化

* GPU 内存层次：

  * **HBM（显存）**：大、但慢。
  * **寄存器/L1/L2 cache（片上内存）**：小、但极快。
* FlashAttention 设计时就考虑到这一点：

  * 尽可能把数据存在 **片上 SRAM / 寄存器**，
  * 避免频繁写入 HBM。

---

## 3. 为什么更快（即使 FLOPs 更多）

* 普通 Attention FLOPs 较少，但 **I/O 成本极高**（写读大矩阵）。
* FlashAttention FLOPs 更多（计算更复杂），但 **I/O 极少**。
* 在 GPU 上，算力其实不贵（TFLOPS 很高），而 **HBM 带宽才是瓶颈**。
* 所以，**算力换内存** = 更快。

---

## 4. 实际效果

* 示例里：

  * `torch.compile` 后：**130 ms / iteration**。
  * 加上 FlashAttention：**96 ms / iteration**。
  * **再快了 \~27%**。

* 论文报告：FlashAttention 最多可以比普通实现快 **7.6x**（取决于 seq\_len 和硬件）。

---

## 5. 与 `torch.compile` 的区别

* `torch.compile`：自动发现可融合的算子 → Kernel Fusion。
* FlashAttention：**需要算法层面的重写**（online softmax）。
* 因此，`torch.compile` **不能自己发现** FlashAttention，必须显式调用 **`scaled_dot_product_attention`** API。

---

## 6. 总结

* **普通 Attention**：存大矩阵 → 显存 I/O 瓶颈。
* **FlashAttention**：

  1. 不存矩阵（online softmax）。
  2. 算子融合。
  3. 优化内存层次。
* **结果**：即使 FLOPs ↑，速度还是更快。

一句话总结：
👉 FlashAttention 是 **为 Transformer Attention 特化的高效内核**，通过算法重写和内存访问优化，把训练速度提升了 1.2x \~ 7.6x。

要不要我给你画一张对比图（普通 Attention vs FlashAttention 的数据流），直观展示 **显存流量差别**？



# nice/ugly numbers. vocab size 50257 → 50304, 93ms

the dumbest and the most brilliant optimization and it's always a little bit surprising to me um anyway so
basically I mentioned a few minutes ago that there are some numbers that are nice and some numbers that are ugly so
64 is a beautiful nice number 128 is even nicer 256 is beautiful what makes
these numbers beautiful is that there are many powers of two inside them you can divide by two many times and uh
examples of ugly numbers are like 13 and 17 and something like that prime numbers numbers that are not even and so on and
so pretty much you always want to use nice numbers in all of your code that deals with neural networks or Cuda
because everything in Cuda Works in sort of like powers of two and lots of kernels are written in terms of powers
of Two And there are lots of blocks of sizes 16 and uh 64 and so on so
everything is written in those terms and you always have special case handling for all kinds of uh logic that U when
your inputs are not made of nice numbers so let's see what that looks like basically scan your code and look for
ugly numbers is roughly theistic so three times is kind of ugly um I'm not
100% sure maybe this can be improved but this is uh this is ugly and not ideal um four times is nice so that's uh
that's nice 1024 is very nice that's a power of two
12 is a little bit suspicious um not too many powers of two 768 is great 50, 257
is a really really ugly number um it's first of all it's odd so uh and there's
no not too many powers of two in there so this is a very ugly number and it's highly suspicious and then when we
scroll down all these numbers are nice and then here we have mostly nice numbers except for 25 so in this
configuration of gpt2 XL a number of heads is 25 uh that's a really ugly number that's an odd number and um
actually this did cause a lot of headaches for us recently when we're trying to optimize some kernels uh to run this fast um and required a bunch of
special case handling so basically these numbers are we have some ugly numbers
and some of them are easier to fix than others and in particular the voap size being 50257 that's a very ugly number
very suspicious and we want to fix it now when you when you fix these things uh one of the easy ways to do that is
you basically um increase the number until it's the nearest power of two that
you like so here's a much nicer number it's 50304 and why is that because 50304 can
be divided by 8 or by 16 or by 32
64 it can even be divided by 128 I think yeah so it's a very nice number um so
what we're going to do here is the GPT config and you see that we initialized B cap size to
50257 Let's override just that um element to be
50304 okay so everything else stays the same we're just increasing our vocabulary size so we're adding it's
almost like we're adding fake tokens uh so that book up size has powers of two inside it now actually what I'm doing
here by the way is I'm increasing the amount of computation that our network will be doing if you just count the the flops on like do the math of how many
flops we're doing we're going to be doing more flops and we still have to think through whether this doesn't break
anything but if I just run this uh let's see what we get uh currently this ran in
maybe 96.5 milliseconds per step I'm just kind
of like eyeballing it and let's see what kind of a result we're going to get uh while this is compiling let's
think through whether our code actually works okay when we increase the vocap size like this let's look at where vocap
size is actually used so we swing up to the inet and we see that it's used inside the embedding
table of course so all the way at the bottom of the Transformer and it's used at the classifier layer all the way at the top of the Transformer so in two
places and let's take a look and we're running at 93 so 93 milliseconds instead
of 96.5 so we are seeing a roughly yeah 4%
Improvement here uh by doing more calculations and the reason for this is
we fixed we've made an ugly number into a nice number let's I'm going to come
into the explanation for that a little bit again but for now let's just convince ourselves that we're not breaking anything when we do this so
first of all we've made the the wte the embedding table for the tokens we've made it larger it's almost like we
introduced more tokens at the bottom and these tokens are never used because the
gbt tokenizer only has tokens up to $50,000 256 and so we'll never index into the
rows that we've added so we're wasting a little bit of space here by creating memory that's never going to be accessed
never going to be used Etc now that's not fully correct because this wte
weight ends up being shared and ends up being used in the classifier here at the end so what is that doing to the
classifier right here well what what that's doing is we're predicting additional Dimensions at the classifier
now and we're predicting probabilities for tokens that will of course never be present in the training set um and so
therefore the network has to learn that these probabilities uh have to be driven to zero and so the logits that the
network produces have to drive those dimensions of the output to negative Infinity but it that's no different from
all the other tokens that are already in our data set um or rather that are not in our data set so Shakespeare only
probably uses let's say a th000 tokens out of 50,000 to 57 tokens so most of the tokens are already being driven to
zero probability by the optimization we' just introduced a few more tokens now that in a similar manner will never be
used and have to be driven to zero in probability um so functionally though
nothing breaks we're using a bit more extra um memory but otherwise this is a
harmless operation as far as I can tell but and we're adding calculation but it's running faster and it's running
faster because as I mentioned in Cuda so many kernels use uh block tiles and
these block towels are usually nice numbers uh so powers of two so calculations are done in like chunks of
64 or chunks of 32 and when your um when your desired calculation doesn't neatly
fit into those block tiles um there are all kinds of boundary kernels that can
kick in to like do the last part so basically in a lot of kernels they will
chunk at up your input and they will do the nice part first and then they have a whole second second phase where they
come back to any that like uh remains uh and then they process the remaining part
and the kernels for that could be very inefficient and so you're basically um spinning up all this extra compute and
is extremely inefficient so you might as well pad your inputs and um make it fit
nicely and usually that empiric lens up actually running faster um so this is
another example of a 4% Improvement that we've added and this is something that
also torch compile did not find for us you would hope that torch compile at some point could figure an optimization
like this out uh but for now uh this is it and I also have to point out that we're using pytorch nightly so that's
why we're only seeing 4% if you're using pytorch 2.3.1 or earlier you would
actually see something like 30% Improvement just from this change from changing it to from 50,000 to 57 to
50304 so again one of my favorite examples also of having to understand
the under the hood and how it all works and to know what kinds of things to Tinker with to push the performance of your code okay so at this point we have

当然可以，以下是关于 **「将词表大小从 50257 改为 50304，提高性能」** 的中文解释：

## 🧠 好数（nice numbers）vs. 坏数（ugly numbers）

在深度学习和 GPU 编程（特别是 CUDA）中，有些数字被称为「**好数（nice numbers）**」，有些是「**坏数（ugly numbers）**」。

### 什么是好数？

* 具有很多 **2 的倍数因子（即：可被 2、4、8、16... 整除）**
* 如：64、128、256、1024，这些都非常适合 CUDA 内核运行
* 因为 GPU 的计算单元、内存块等都是按照这些「块大小」设计的，处理这类数非常高效

### 什么是坏数？

* **奇数或质数（如 13、17、25、50257）**
* **不能整除内核块大小，会导致额外开销**
* 会触发 GPU 内核中的「特殊处理逻辑」，降低效率

---

## 🧩 问题：词表大小是 50257，这是个「坏数」

GPT-2 的原始词表大小是 `50257`，这是个非常丑的数字：

* 不是 2 的倍数
* 在 CUDA 中会引起额外的处理开销（例如：无法整齐划分成 GPU 的 block tiles）

---

## 💡 解决方法：把词表大小「向上补齐」为一个好数

作者将词表大小改为：

```python
vocab_size = 50304
```

这个数很好：

* 50304 可以被 8、16、32、64、128 整除
* 非常适合 GPU 内核运行，避免了额外边界处理（boundary kernel）

---

## ✅ 会不会出错？会不会影响模型训练？

不会出错。原因如下：

### 词表扩展带来的影响：

1. **embedding 层：**

   * 原本有 50257 个 token，现在增加了一些「永远不会使用」的 token。
   * 因为 tokenizer 永远不会生成 ID 超过 50256 的 token，所以这些 embedding 永远不会被索引到。

2. **分类层（输出层）：**

   * 输出现在变成了 50304 维，模型需要输出一些「永远不会出现的 token 的概率」
   * 网络会自动学会把这些概率压到极小（logits → 负无穷 → softmax ≈ 0）
   * 跟原本就从没出现的 token 是一样的处理方式

3. **额外开销：**

   * 占用少量内存和计算，但带来了性能提升，**是值得的 trade-off**

---

## 📈 性能提升效果

* 原本每一步训练耗时：**96.5ms**
* 修改后耗时：**93ms**
* **提升约 4%**

  * 在 PyTorch nightly 版本下是 4%
  * 在 PyTorch 2.3.1 或更早版本中，这个修改可带来 **高达 30% 提升**！

为什么会更快？

* GPU 内核更容易「整块处理」而不是「边界处理」
* 避免使用额外慢速的尾部逻辑
* 计算更高效，吞吐量提升

---

## 🧪 总结

| 优化项        | 原来       | 修改后      | 是否更快   | 原因                           |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |

# SECTION 3: hyperpamaters, AdamW, gradient clipping

improved the performance by about 11x right because we started at about 1,000 milliseconds per step and we're now down
to like 93 milliseconds so that's uh quite good and we're uh doing a much
better job of utilizing our GPU resources so I'm going to now turn to more algorithmic changes uh and
improvements to the actual optimization itself and what we would like to do is we would like to follow the hyper parameters that are mentioned in the GP
G2 or gpt2 gpt3 paper now sadly gpt2 is
uh doesn't actually say too much it's very nice of them that they released the model weights and the code but the paper
itself is extremely vague as to the optimization details uh the code itself that they released as well the code
we've been looking at this is just the inference code so there's no training code here and very few hyp parameters so
this doesn't also tell us too much so for that we have to turn to the gpt3 paper and um in the depending of the
gpt3 paper um they have a lot more hyper parameters here for us to use and the
gpt3 paper in general is a lot more detailed as to uh all of the you know
small details that go into the model training but gpt3 U models were never released so gbt2 we have the weights but
no details and gpt3 we have lots of details but no weights so um but roughly
speaking gpt2 and gpt3 architectures are very very similar and um basically there
are very few changes the context length was expanded from 1024 to 2048 and that's kind of like the major change uh
and some of the hyper parameters around the Transformer have changed but otherwise they're pretty much the same model it's just that gpt3 was trained
for a lot longer on a bigger data set and uh has a lot more thorough evaluations uh and the gpt3 model is 175
billion instead of 1.6 billion um in the gpt2 so long story short we're going to
go to gp3 paper to follow along some the hyper parameters so to train all the
versions of gpt3 we use atom with beta 1 beta 2 of9 and .95 so let's swing over
here and make sure that the betas parameter which you can see here defaults to 0.9 and
999 is actually set to 0.9 and .95 and then the Epsilon parameter uh
you can see is the default is 1 in8 and this is also one in8 let's just uh put
it in so that works expit uh now next up they say we clip
the gra Global Norm of the gradient at 1.0 so what this is referring to is that
once we calculate the gradients right after l. backward um we basically have
the gradients at all the parameter tensors and what people like to do is
basically uh clip them to have some kind of a maximum Norm so in pytor this is fairly easy to do uh it's one line of
code here that we have to insert right after we calcul Cal the gradients and what this utility function is doing is
um it's calculating the global Norm of the parameters so every single par um
gradient on all the parameters you square it and you add it all up and you take a big square root of that and
that's the norm of the parameter V Vector basically it's the it's the
length of it if you if you'd like to look at it that way and we are basically making sure that its length is no more
than 1.0 and we're going to clip it and the reason that people like to use this is that uh sometimes you can get
unlucky during your optimization maybe it's a bad data batch or something like that and if you get very unlucky in the
batch you might get really high loss and really high loss could lead to a really high gradient and this could basically
uh shock your model and shock the optimization so people like to use a gradient Norm clipping uh to prevent the
model from um basically getting too big of shocks in terms of the gradient magnet ude and uh the upper bound it in
this way it's a bit of a hacky solution it's about like a patch on top of like deeper issues uh but uh people still do
it fairly frequently now the clip grad Norm Returns the norm of the gradient
which I like to always visualize uh because um it is useful information and
sometimes you can look at the norm of the gradient and if it's well behaved things are good if it's climbing things
are bad and they're destabilizing during training sometimes you could get a spike in the norm and that means there's some
kind of an issue or an instability so the norm here will be a
norm uh and let's do a uh 4f or something like
that and I believe this is just a float and so we should be able to uh print
that uh so that's Global gradient clipping now they go into the details of
the learning rate uh scheduler so they don't just use a fixed learning rate like we do here for 3 E4 but there's
actually basically a cosine DK learning rate schedule um it's got a warm-up and
it's got a cosine DEC to 10% over some Horizon
um and so we're going to implement uh this in a second I just like to see Norm
printed here okay there we go so what happened here is the norm is actually really high in the beginning 30 or so
and you see that as we continue training it kind of like stabilizes um at values below one um and
this is not that crazy uncommon for the norm to be high in the very first few stages basically What's Happening Here
is the model is completely random and so there's a ton of learning happening very early in the network but that learning
is kind of like um you know it's mostly learning the biases of the output tokens
and so it's a bit of an unstable time uh but the network usually stabilizes in a very few iterations so this looks very
relatively reasonable to me except usually I would expect this looks a little bit funky that we go from 28 to 6
to 2 and then to 10 um it's not completely insane but it's just kind of
a little bit funky um okay so let's now get to the learning rate schuer so the learning

## 📌 第 3 节：超参数、AdamW、梯度裁剪（Hyperparameters, AdamW, Gradient Clipping）

---

### 🚀 1. **整体背景：性能已提升约 11 倍**

* 一开始每步迭代耗时约 **1000ms**
* 经过优化（如 TF32、混合精度、torch.compile、Flash Attention 等），现在只需 **93ms**
* 显著提升了 GPU 的使用效率 ✅

---

## 🔧 2. 优化算法：从 GPT-3 论文中提取超参数

### 🤔 为什么参考 GPT-3 而不是 GPT-2？

* **GPT-2 论文**：几乎没有写优化细节，只公布了模型权重和推理代码
* **GPT-3 论文**：没有公开模型，但**详细列出所有训练细节和超参数**

所以尽管 GPT-3 的模型没开源，我们仍然可以用它的训练设置。

---

## 🧮 3. Adam 优化器设置（AdamW）

GPT-3 使用的参数是：

```python
betas = (0.9, 0.95)
epsilon = 1e-8
```

* 默认的 Adam 是 `(0.9, 0.999)`，这里把第二个 beta 减小了，代表更快地跟随梯度方向的变化
* `epsilon` 保持不变（是防止除以 0 的一个极小值）

---

## ✂️ 4. 梯度裁剪（Gradient Clipping）

### 🚨 问题：

* 如果某个 batch 的 loss 很高，可能导致梯度爆炸
* 这会「冲击」模型参数，造成训练不稳定

### ✅ 解决：

加入 **全局梯度裁剪**（clip grad norm）：

```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

含义：

* 将所有参数的梯度当作一个大向量，算它的 **L2 范数**
* 如果它大于 `1.0`，就整体缩放使其变成 1.0
* 就像控制「一次最多走多远」，防止模型「狂跳」

> 虽然这有点像是对 deeper 问题的临时修补，但在大规模训练中仍被广泛使用。

### 📊 打印梯度范数（调试用）

为了了解训练中是否稳定，可以打印出当前的梯度范数：

```python
print(f"Grad norm: {grad_norm:.4f}")
```

观察输出：

* 训练刚开始时，梯度 norm 可能很大（30+），是正常的
* 几步后它会变得比较小并稳定（<1）

如果出现 **忽高忽低、大跳变**，说明训练可能不稳定，需要检查数据或学习率等设置。

---

接下来，视频还会介绍 **学习率调度器（如 warmup + cosine decay）**，是训练中非常重要的一部分。如果你想，我可以继续为你翻译和总结这一部分内容。

需要继续吗？

好，这一段在讲 **训练优化过程中的超参数 (hyperparameters)、AdamW、梯度裁剪 (gradient clipping)**。我帮你分点拆解：

---

## 1. 背景

* 一开始代码优化只做了硬件级别的提升（比如 `torch.compile`、FlashAttention），训练速度从 **1000ms → 93ms/step**，提速了 \~11x。
* 接下来要做的是 **算法层面的优化**，即 **优化器和超参数设置**，以便训练更稳定、更高效。

---

## 2. GPT-2 vs GPT-3 超参数来源

* **GPT-2**：虽然开源了权重和推理代码，但 **训练细节写得很少**。
* **GPT-3**：没有开源权重，但 **论文里写了很多训练细节（超参数）**。
  👉 因此，在复现时通常参考 GPT-3 的训练配置。

---

## 3. AdamW 超参数

GPT-3 使用 **Adam 优化器**（严格来说是 AdamW = Adam + weight decay），并且设置了：

* **β1 = 0.9**

* **β2 = 0.95**
  （PyTorch 默认 β2=0.999，GPT-3 把它改小了，让模型对近期梯度更敏感，更新更快一些）

* **ε (epsilon) = 1e-8**
  （防止除零错误，和默认值一样，但他们明确写出来了）

---

## 4. 梯度裁剪 (Gradient Clipping)

* 在每次反向传播 (`loss.backward()`) 得到梯度之后，通常梯度大小（norm）会有波动。
* 如果某个 batch 产生了 **异常大的梯度**（可能是坏数据，或者 loss 突然暴涨），会“冲击”模型，导致训练不稳定甚至发散。
* **解决办法**：裁剪梯度的全局范数（global norm），比如设上限 = 1.0。

### 原理

* 所有梯度 flatten 成一个大向量 `g`。
* 计算 `||g||₂ = sqrt(Σ gᵢ²)`。
* 如果 `||g||₂ > 1.0`，就按比例缩小，使其最大值不超过 1.0。

PyTorch 一行搞定：

```python
norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)
```

这里 `norm` 会返回裁剪前的梯度范数，方便我们监控。

---

## 5. 为什么有用

* 防止梯度“爆炸”。
* 提高训练稳定性。
* 属于一个 “实用的小技巧”，虽然本质上是 **patch（补丁）**，并不是解决深层原因。

---

## 6. 实际效果

* 作者打印了 `gradient norm`，结果发现：

  * 训练初期 norm = 20\~30 很大，因为模型随机初始化，loss 也很大，学习率爆炸。
  * 几个 step 之后 norm 会收敛到 < 1，说明训练逐渐稳定。
* 偶尔 norm 会突然跳动（从 2 → 10），代表训练中有不稳定因素。

---

## 7. 下一步（学习率调度）

* 目前用的是固定学习率 `3e-4`，但 GPT-3 用了更复杂的调度：

  * **Warmup**：前期逐渐增大学习率（防止刚开始梯度太大爆炸）。
  * **Cosine Decay**：后期学习率逐渐衰减到初始值的 10%。
    👉 这样可以让模型训练更平稳、收敛更好。

---

## ✅ 总结

1. **AdamW 超参数**：β1=0.9, β2=0.95, ε=1e-8。
2. **梯度裁剪**：把全局梯度范数限制在 ≤1.0，防止梯度爆炸。
3. **监控 norm**：可以判断训练是否稳定。
4. **学习率调度**：GPT-3 使用 **warmup + cosine decay**，比固定学习率效果更好。

---

要不要我给你写一段 **带梯度裁剪 + 学习率调度** 的 PyTorch 代码（复现 GPT-3 的训练配置）？

# ||g||₂ 是什么意思

好问题 👍

这里的 `||g||₂` 表示的是 **向量 g 的 L₂ 范数（也叫 Euclidean norm，欧几里得范数）**。

---

### 1. 向量 g 是什么？

在梯度裁剪里，`g` 代表 **所有参数的梯度拼接起来的大向量**。
比如：

* 如果模型有 3 个参数，梯度分别是 `[0.5, -1.0, 2.0]`，那 `g = [0.5, -1.0, 2.0]`。
* 实际上模型可能有几百万个参数，所有梯度都会拼成一个超长的向量。

---

### 2. L₂ 范数的定义

数学里：

$$
||g||_{2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n g_i^2}
$$

意思是：把所有分量平方后加起来，再开平方根。
这其实就是我们常说的 **向量的长度**（几何意义上是到原点的直线距离）。

举个例子：

* `g = [3, 4]`
* `||g||₂ = sqrt(3² + 4²) = sqrt(25) = 5`

---

### 3. 在梯度裁剪里为什么用 L₂ 范数？

* 因为它能衡量整个梯度向量的“整体大小”。
* 如果 `||g||₂` 太大，说明梯度“爆炸”。
* 裁剪方法就是：

  $$
  g \leftarrow \frac{g}{||g||_2} \cdot \text{clip\_value}
  $$

  比如 `clip_value = 1.0`，就把梯度缩放到长度不超过 1.

---

⚡ 简单记忆：

* `||g||₂` = 梯度向量的 **长度**。
* 裁剪梯度，就是 **防止这条“梯度向量”太长，给模型带来冲击**。

---

要不要我给你写个 **小 Python 例子**，算一组梯度的 `||g||₂` 并演示怎么裁剪？

# 如何按比例缩小

对的 ✅
所谓 **“按比例缩小”**，就是把梯度向量整体 **除以它的长度**，再乘上一个允许的最大长度（比如 1.0）。

---

### 数学公式

如果原始梯度是 $g$，它的 L₂ 范数是

$$
||g||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i} g_i^2}
$$

裁剪后的梯度 $g'$ 为：

$$
g' = g \cdot \frac{\text{clip\_value}}{||g||_2}
\quad \text{如果 } ||g||_2 > \text{clip\_value}
$$

否则就保持不变。

---

### 举个例子

假设：

* 梯度向量 $g = [3, 4]$
* 那么 $||g||_2 = \sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$
* 设定最大允许长度 `clip_value = 1.0`

那么裁剪后：

$$
g' = [3, 4] \times \frac{1.0}{5}
   = [0.6, 0.8]
$$

此时 `||g'||₂ = 1.0`，刚好被缩放到最大值。

---

### Python 演示

```python
import torch

g = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0])
clip_value = 1.0

norm = torch.norm(g, p=2)  # 计算 ||g||₂
if norm > clip_value:
    g = g * (clip_value / norm)

print(g)  # tensor([0.6000, 0.8000])
print(torch.norm(g, p=2))  # 1.0
```

---

👉 这样就保证了：

* **方向不变**（梯度方向没变）。
* **长度被缩到 clip\_value 以内**。

要不要我也给你画个 **二维向量缩小前后的图**，更直观展示？

# 详细讲解一下 AdamW

好的！下面把 **AdamW** 讲透：它是什么、为什么比 Adam 更好、公式怎么写、怎么在 PyTorch 里用、以及跟超参（β₁/β₂/ε/weight\_decay）、梯度裁剪、参数分组之间的最佳实践。

---

# AdamW 是什么？

**AdamW = Adam（自适应优化） + “解耦”的权重衰减（Weight Decay）**。
关键点在“**解耦**”：把权重衰减当作**对参数本身的缩减**，而不是把 `λ·w` 加到梯度里（L2 正则）。这点对自适应方法（Adam/Adamax/Adagrad…）很重要，因为把 L2 加到梯度里会和自适应缩放纠缠，导致“名为 weight decay、实为别的东西”的副作用。AdamW 把它**从梯度更新中拆出来单独做**，泛化更好、更可控。

---

# 与 Adam 的本质区别

* **Adam（带 L2 正则）**：
  先把 `λ·w` 加到梯度里，再走 Adam 的自适应更新。
* **AdamW（解耦衰减）**：
  先按 Adam 的自适应规则更新参数；**另起一条独立的“衰减”步**对参数做 `w ← w - lr·λ·w`（或等价的 `w ← (1 - lr·λ)·w`）。
  这样衰减幅度不被 `v̂`/`ε` 等自适应项影响，名副其实就是“weight decay”。

---

# 数学更新（一步）

令当前步梯度为 $g_t$，参数为 $w_t$，超参 $\beta_1,\beta_2,\epsilon, \lambda$（权重衰减），学习率 $\alpha$。

**Adam 的一部分（带偏置校正）：**

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_t &= \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) g_t \\
v_t &= \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) g_t^2 \\
\hat m_t &= \frac{m_t}{1-\beta_1^t},\quad
\hat v_t = \frac{v_t}{1-\beta_2^t} \\
\tilde g_t &= \frac{\hat m_t}{\sqrt{\hat v_t}+\epsilon}
\end{aligned}
$$

**AdamW 更新：**

$$
\underbrace{w_{t+\frac12} = w_t - \alpha \,\tilde g_t}_{\text{Adam 自适应步}}
\qquad
\underbrace{w_{t+1} = w_{t+\frac12} - \alpha \lambda \, w_{t+\frac12}}_{\text{解耦权重衰减}}
$$

（实现里常写成对 $w_t$ 做 `w -= lr*wd*w`，与上式等价到一阶）

> 要点：**衰减幅度与梯度无关**，不会被 $\hat v_t$、$\epsilon$ 稀释或放大。

---

# 超参数怎么选（以 GPT 类模型为例）

* **betas**：

  * 经典默认 `β1=0.9, β2=0.999`。
  * **GPT-3** 用 **`β1=0.9, β2=0.95`**（更“灵敏”，对近期梯度更敏感，适合大批量、长训练）。
* **epsilon（ε）**：常用 `1e-8`；太大会让分母偏大、步长变小。
* **weight\_decay（λ）**：预训练常见 **0.1**；微调可用 **0.01 \~ 0.1**。

  * **不要**对 `bias` 和 `LayerNorm/BatchNorm 的权重` 使用 weight decay（经验规则）。
* **学习率（lr）**：与 batch、模型大小、schedule 强相关；GPT 系常配 **warmup + cosine decay**。
* **梯度裁剪**：配合 **global norm clipping = 1.0** 很常见，抑制偶发梯度爆冲。

---

# PyTorch 正确用法（含参数分组 + 裁剪）

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.utils import clip_grad_norm_

# 1) 参数分组：不给 bias / LayerNorm 权重做衰减
decay, no_decay = [], []
for name, p in model.named_parameters():
    if not p.requires_grad:
        continue
    if p.ndim >= 2:   # 经验：矩阵/卷积核做衰减
        decay.append(p)
    else:             # bias、LayerNorm.weight 等不做衰减
        no_decay.append(p)

optim = torch.optim.AdamW(
    [
        {"params": decay,    "weight_decay": 0.1},
        {"params": no_decay, "weight_decay": 0.0},
    ],
    lr=3e-4,
    betas=(0.9, 0.95),  # GPT-3 风格
    eps=1e-8
)

# 2) 训练步：先 backward，先裁剪，再 step
optim.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():   # 若用混合精度
    logits, loss = model(x, y)
scaler.scale(loss).backward()     # 若用 AMP 的 GradScaler
# 或者：loss.backward()

# 全局范数裁剪（典型阈值 1.0）
clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

# 再更新
# 若用 AMP：
scaler.step(optim); scaler.update()
# 若不用 AMP：
# optim.step()
```

> **为什么要分组？**
> 对 `bias / LayerNorm.weight` 做衰减通常会伤泛化与收敛；把它们放进 `no_decay` 组更稳。

---

# 常见问题与建议

* **Adam vs AdamW**：用 **AdamW**。PyTorch 的 `torch.optim.AdamW` 已是解耦版本；而 `torch.optim.Adam(weight_decay=...)` 则等价于 L2 正则（不解耦）。
* **与学习率调度**：AdamW 通常配 **warmup（如 1–2% 步数）+ cosine decay 到 10% 终值**。
* **β₂ 该不该 0.95？**

  * 大模型/大 batch：`0.95` 常更稳；
  * 小模型/小 batch：`0.999` 也可。
* **ε 要调吗？** 多数情况下保留 `1e-8`；只有在数值很抖时再考虑微调。
* **权重衰减多大？** 预训练常 `0.1`；微调任务可 `0.01~0.1` 试网格搜索。
* **配合梯度裁剪**：裁剪放在 `backward()` 之后、`optimizer.step()` 之前（上面的顺序已正确）。
* **与 AMP/TF32**：数值精度方案（AMP/TF32）不改变优化器定义，但会改变数值噪声；结合梯度裁剪与合适的 `β₂/ε` 更稳。

---

# 一句话记忆

**AdamW = Adam 的自适应更新 + 独立的“参数缩减”步。**
把 weight decay 从梯度里解耦，既**名副其实地衰减权重**，又**提升泛化**，是现代 Transformer 训练的默认选择。


# learning rate scheduler: warmup + cosine decay

rate schedule that's used here in gpt3 is what's called a cosine Decay learning
schedule with warmup and the way this looks is that the learning rate is basically starts right at around zero
linearly rank s up over some amount of time and then comes down with this cosine sort of form and comes down to
some kind of a minimum learning rate that's up to you so here the minimum learning rate is zero but uh here in the
paper they said that they use cosine Decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value over the first 260 billion
tokens and then training continues 10% after and there's a linear warmup over
the first 375 million tokens so that's about the learn R so let's now implement
this uh so I already implemented it here and the way this works is let me scroll
down first here I changed our training Loop a little bit so this was a 4i in Max steps I just change it to step now
so that we have the notion of a step is a single optimization step in the in the
for Loop and then here I get the LR for this step of the optimization using a
new function I call get LR and then in pytorch to set the learning rate I think this is is the way to set the learning
rate it's a little bit gnarly um because you have to basically there's a notion of different par parameter groups that
could exist in the optimizer and so you actually have to iterate over them even though we currently have a single param
group only um and you have to set the LR in this for Loop kind of style is is my
impression right now so we have this look of LR we set the learning rate and then on the bottom I'm also printing it
uh so that's all the changes I made to this Loop and then of course the get LR is my scheduler now it's worth pointing
out that pytorch actually has learning rate schedulers and you can use them and I believe there's a cosine learning rate
schedule in pytorch I just don't really love using that code because honestly
it's like five lines of code and I fully understand what's happening inside these lines so I don't love to use
abstractions where they're kind of in screwable and then I don't know what they're doing so personal style so the
max learning rate here is let's say 3 E4 but we're going to see that in gpt3
here they have a table of what the maximum learning rate is for every model
size so um for for this one basically 12
12 layer 768 gpt3 so the gpt3 small is roughly like a GPT
2124m we see that here they use a learning rate of 6 E4 so we could actually go higher um in fact we may
want to try to follow that and just set the max LR here at six uh then the that's the maximum learning
rate the minum learning rate is uh 10% of that per description in the paper
some number of steps that we're going to warm up over and then the maximum steps of the optimization which I now use also
in the for Loop down here and then you can go over this code if you like it's not U it's not terribly inside Flor
interesting I'm just uh modulating based on the iteration number which learning rate uh there should be so this is the
warm-up region um this is the region after the optimization and then this is the region
sort of in between and this is where I calculate the cosine learning rate schedule and you can step through this
in detail if you'd like uh but this is basically implementing this curve and I ran this already and this is
what that looks like um so when we now run we start at
um some very low number now note that we don't start exactly at zero because that would be not useful to update with a
learning rate of zero that's why there's an it+ one so that on the zeroth iteration we are not using exactly zero
we're using something very very low then we linearly warm up to maximum learning rate which in this case was 34 when I
ran it but now would be 6 E4 and then it starts to decay all the way down to um 3
E5 which was at the time 10% of the original learning rate now one thing we are not following exactly is that they
mentioned that um let me see if I can find it
again we're not exactly following what they did because uh they mentioned that their
training Horizon is 300 billion tokens and they come down to 10% of the initial learning rate of at 260 billion and then
they train after 260 with 10% so basically their Decay time is less than
the max steps time whereas for us they're exactly equal so it's not exactly faithful but it's um it's an
okay um this is okay for us and for our purposes right now and um we're just
going to use this ourselves I don't think it makes too too big of a difference honestly I should point out that what learning rate schedule you use
is totally up to you there's many different types um coign learning rate has been popularized a lot by gpt2 and
gpt3 but people have come up with all kinds of uh other learning rate schedules um and this is kind of like an
active area of uh research as to which one is the most effective at train these networks okay next up the paper talks

## 🧠 学习率调度器：**预热（warmup）+ 余弦退火（cosine decay）**

---

### 🔺 1. 什么是「余弦退火 + warmup」学习率策略？

它的学习率变化曲线大致如下：

```
（Y轴是学习率，X轴是训练步骤）

 ↑
 |                ／‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾＼
 |              ／                ＼
 |            ／                    ＼
 |__________/                        \___________→

      ↑                            ↑
   warmup阶段         cosine逐渐减小到最低值
```

* **Warmup阶段**：一开始从很小的学习率线性上升到最大值（防止刚开始模型不稳定）
* **Cosine阶段**：之后沿着一个**余弦曲线**缓慢下降（平滑退火），直到达到最低学习率

---

### 📖 GPT-3 是怎么设置的？

根据论文描述：

* **总训练步数**（以 token 数计）：`3000亿`
* **Warmup 步数**：`3.75亿 tokens`
* **Cosine 下降区间**：从最大值下降到 **初始学习率的 10%**，持续到 `2600亿 tokens`
* 剩下的 `400亿 tokens` 使用这个 10% 的最小学习率继续训练

---

### 🧪 实际代码中怎么实现？

```python
# 每一步使用一个函数 get_lr() 来计算当前的学习率
lr = get_lr(step)

# 然后通过 optimizer.param_groups 设置学习率
for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = lr
```

这个循环是因为 PyTorch 的优化器可能有多个参数组（比如有的要 weight decay，有的不需要），尽管我们这里只用一个组，但仍需循环。

---

### 🧮 get\_lr() 函数大致逻辑：

```python
if step < warmup_iters:
    # Warmup 线性上升阶段
    return max_lr * step / warmup_iters
elif step > total_iters:
    # Cosine 后期，保持最低学习率
    return min_lr
else:
    # 中间阶段，执行余弦退火
    decay_ratio = (step - warmup_iters) / (total_iters - warmup_iters)
    cosine_decay = 0.5 * (1 + cos(pi * decay_ratio))
    return min_lr + (max_lr - min_lr) * cosine_decay
```

### 示例参数：

* `max_lr = 6e-4`（从 GPT-3 对应模型大小中获取）
* `min_lr = 6e-5`（10%）
* `warmup_iters = 200`
* `total_iters = 6000`

---

### 🖼️ 输出样例（可视化观察）：

* 初始几步：学习率从接近 0 开始（但不会是绝对的 0）
* 快速上升至 `max_lr`
* 然后逐步下降到 `min_lr`

---

### 📌 小细节：

> GPT-3 是在 2600 亿 tokens 时下降到 10%，然后继续用这个 10% 的值训练到 3000 亿
> 而这段代码中，我们简化了逻辑：**总训练步数内直接从 max\_lr 退火到 min\_lr**，没有继续保持常数阶段

这是一个合理的近似，不会有太大问题。

---

### 📈 学习率调度是一个活跃研究方向

* GPT 系列 popularize 了 cosine decay + warmup
* 但也有其他策略，比如：

  * step decay
  * exponential decay
  * cyclical learning rates
  * one-cycle policy
* 没有统一标准，「调得好」比「理论最优」更重要 ✅

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你：

* 可视化这段余弦学习率曲线
* 用中文实现这段 PyTorch 的调度器逻辑
* 或者总结不同学习率策略的对比

需要的话请告诉我\~

好问题！这段在讲 **GPT-3 的学习率调度器 (learning rate scheduler)** ——它不是固定的学习率，而是一个随训练进度变化的曲线。我们逐条拆开：

---

## 1. 为什么要用学习率调度 (LR scheduler)？

* **大模型训练早期**：网络参数随机初始化，直接用较大学习率会“炸掉”；所以先 **warmup（线性升温）**，让模型逐渐适应。
* **中期**：保持在最大值一段时间，高效学习。
* **后期**：逐渐降低学习率（cosine decay），避免模型在收敛阶段震荡，提高泛化。

---

## 2. Warmup + Cosine Decay 曲线

学习率随训练步数 $t$ 的变化大致是这样：

1. **Warmup 阶段（线性上升）**

   * 从接近 0 开始，线性升到 **最大学习率 $lr_{max}$**
   * GPT-3：在 **前 375M tokens** 内完成 warmup。

   $$
   lr(t) = lr_{max} \cdot \frac{t}{T_{warmup}}, \quad 0 \le t < T_{warmup}
   $$

2. **Cosine Decay 阶段（余弦下降）**

   * 从 $lr_{max}$ 逐渐衰减到 **最小学习率 $lr_{min}$**。
   * GPT-3：在 **260B tokens** 内衰减到 $0.1 \cdot lr_{max}$。

   $$
   lr(t) = lr_{min} + \tfrac{1}{2}(lr_{max} - lr_{min}) 
           \Big(1 + \cos\!\big(\pi \cdot \tfrac{t - T_{warmup}}{T_{decay}}\big)\Big)
   $$

3. **收尾阶段（保持最低学习率）**

   * GPT-3：260B tokens 以后，学习率固定在 **$0.1 \cdot lr_{max}$**，直到训练结束。

---

## 3. GPT-3 的具体超参数

* **最大学习率**（lr\_max）：依模型大小定（比如小模型 6e-4）。
* **最小学习率**（lr\_min）：$0.1 \cdot lr_{max}$。
* **warmup tokens**：3.75e8（375M tokens）。
* **cosine decay tokens**：2.6e11（260B tokens）。
* **训练总长**：3.0e11（300B tokens）。

换句话说：

* 前 375M token 线性升温；
* 之后到 260B token 逐渐衰减；
* 剩下 40B token 保持 0.1× 学习率。

---

## 4. PyTorch 实现思路

GPT-3 代码里作者手动写了 `get_lr(step)` 函数，自己调度。PyTorch 里也有现成的：

* `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR`（纯 cosine）
* `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR`（带 warmup + decay）

但手写很简单，本质就是几行 if/else：

```python
def get_lr(step, warmup, total_steps, lr_max, lr_min):
    if step < warmup:
        # 线性 warmup
        return lr_max * step / warmup
    elif step < total_steps:
        # cosine decay
        progress = (step - warmup) / (total_steps - warmup)
        return lr_min + 0.5 * (lr_max - lr_min) * (1 + math.cos(math.pi * progress))
    else:
        # 训练结束后保持最低学习率
        return lr_min
```

## 5. 直观图像

曲线大致是：

```
LR
│        ________      (平滑余弦下降)
│       /        \
│      /          \
│_____/             \___________
0   warmup         decay       end
```

---

✅ **一句话总结**：
GPT-3 的学习率调度 = **线性 warmup（前 375M tokens）+ cosine decay 到 0.1×（260B tokens）+ 保持 0.1×（余下训练）**。这样既稳住训练开头，又提升收敛和泛化。

---

要不要我帮你画一个 **cosine decay + warmup 的实际曲线图**（Python matplotlib），这样直观展示学习率随训练步数的变化？


```
max_lr = 6e-4
min_lr = max_lr * 0.1
warmup_steps = 10
max_steps = 50
def get_lr(it):
    # 1) linear warmup for warmup_iters steps
    if it < warmup_steps:
        return max_lr * (it+1) / warmup_steps
    # 2) if it > lr_decay_iters, return min learning rate
    if it > max_steps:
        return min_lr
    # 3) in between, use cosine decay down to min learning rate
    decay_ratio = (it - warmup_steps) / (max_steps - warmup_steps)
    assert 0 <= decay_ratio <= 1
    coeff = 0.5 * (1.0 + math.cos(math.pi * decay_ratio)) # coeff starts at 1 and goes to 0
    return min_lr + coeff * (max_lr - min_lr)
```

很好，这段代码就是在实现我们刚刚讲的 **Warmup + Cosine Decay 学习率调度器**。我来逐行详细拆解：

---

### 参数设定

```python
max_lr = 6e-4              # 最大学习率 (0.0006)
min_lr = max_lr * 0.1      # 最小学习率 (0.00006)，是最大值的 10%
warmup_steps = 10          # 线性 warmup 的步数
max_steps = 50             # 总训练步数（相当于 decay 结束的点）
```

---

### 函数 get\_lr(it)

输入：当前训练步数 `it`
输出：此时的学习率

---

#### 1) Warmup 阶段

```python
if it < warmup_steps:
    return max_lr * (it+1) / warmup_steps
```

* 前 10 步（`warmup_steps=10`），学习率从接近 **0** 线性升到 **max\_lr**。
* `(it+1)` 是为了让第 0 步时学习率不是完全 0，而是一个很小的数（避免训练停滞）。

👉 **举例**：

* step=0 → lr = 0.0006 \* 1/10 = 6e-5
* step=9 → lr = 0.0006 \* 10/10 = 6e-4

---

#### 2) 超过最大步数后的保底值

```python
if it > max_steps:
    return min_lr
```

* 如果训练步数超过设定的 `max_steps=50`，学习率固定在最小值 `min_lr=0.00006`，不再下降。

---

#### 3) Cosine Decay 阶段

```python
decay_ratio = (it - warmup_steps) / (max_steps - warmup_steps)
assert 0 <= decay_ratio <= 1
coeff = 0.5 * (1.0 + math.cos(math.pi * decay_ratio))
return min_lr + coeff * (max_lr - min_lr)
```

* **decay\_ratio**：归一化后的衰减进度，范围 0\~1。

  * `it=warmup_steps=10` → ratio=0
  * `it=max_steps=50` → ratio=1

* **math.cos(π \* decay\_ratio)**：余弦函数从 `cos(0)=1` 逐渐衰减到 `cos(π)=-1`。

* \**coeff = 0.5*(1+cos(...))\*\*：把范围从 `[-1,1]` 映射到 `[0,1]`。

  * decay\_ratio=0 → coeff=1
  * decay\_ratio=1 → coeff=0

* **最终公式**：

$$
lr(it) = lr_{min} + coeff \cdot (lr_{max} - lr_{min})
$$

这样学习率从 **max\_lr** 平滑衰减到 **min\_lr**，曲线是一个半个余弦波。

---

### 总体流程

1. **0\~9 步**：线性 warmup，从 6e-5 升到 6e-4
2. **10\~50 步**：cosine decay，从 6e-4 平滑下降到 6e-5
3. **50 步以后**：固定在 6e-5

---

### 直观图像

如果画图的话，曲线大概是这样的：

```
lr
│        warmup       cosine decay
│       /-----\________
│      /       \        \______
│_____/         \_______________
0    10         50              steps
```

---

要不要我帮你写个 **matplotlib 代码片段**，把这个 `get_lr` 的曲线画出来？这样你能直观看到 warmup + cosine decay 的效果。


```
for param_group in optimizer.param_groups: param_group['lr'] = lr
```

好问题 👍，这几行代码的作用是 **在训练循环里动态更新优化器的学习率**。我来拆解一下：

---

### 背景

在 PyTorch 里，`optimizer`（比如 `AdamW`, `SGD`）通常是这样初始化的：

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
```

这里 `lr=3e-4` 是初始学习率。
但是——如果我们想用 **learning rate scheduler（学习率调度器）**，就必须在训练过程中 **不断修改优化器的学习率**。

---

### `optimizer.param_groups`

* PyTorch 的优化器允许我们对 **不同参数组**（parameter groups）设置不同的超参数，比如：

  * embedding 层：学习率小一些
  * transformer 层：学习率大一些
* 因此，`optimizer.param_groups` 是一个 **列表**，里面的每个元素都是一个 **字典 (dict)**，存放该参数组的超参数：

```python
[ 
  {'params': [...], 'lr': 0.0003, 'weight_decay': 0.01, ...},
  {'params': [...], 'lr': 0.0001, 'weight_decay': 0.00, ...},
]
```

---

### 这段代码

```python
for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = lr
```

意思是：

* 遍历优化器的每个参数组
* 把当前 step 计算出的 **新学习率 `lr`** 更新进去

这样下一次 `optimizer.step()` 的时候，就会用新的学习率更新参数。

---

### 举例

假设现在 scheduler 给出的学习率是 `1e-4`，那么执行后：

```python
for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
    param_group['lr'] = 1e-4
```

所有参数组的学习率都会被设置为 `1e-4`。
如果你有多个参数组，可以选择只更新其中的某几个。

---

✅ 总结一句话：
这段代码就是 **把 scheduler 算出的学习率传给优化器的参数组**，从而实现 **动态学习率调度**。

---

要不要我帮你写个 **完整的例子**（带 `get_lr`、更新 optimizer、打印学习率变化），这样你就能看到调度器在训练中是怎么作用的？



# batch size schedule, weight decay, FusedAdamW, 90ms

about the gradual batch size increase so there's a ramp on the batch size that is
linear and you start with very small batch size and you ramp up to a big batch size over time uh we're going to
actually skip this and we're not going to work with it and the reason I don't love to use it is that it complicates a
lot of the arithmetic because you are changing the number of tokens that you're processing at every single step of the optimization and I like to keep
that math very very simple also my understanding is that that this is not like a major um Improvement and also my
understanding is that this is not like an algorithmic optimization Improvement it's more of a systems and speed
Improvement and roughly speaking this is because uh in the early stages of the
optimization uh again the model is in a very atypical setting and mostly what
you're learning is that um you're mostly learning to ignore the tokens uh that don't come up in your training set very
often you're learning very simple biases and and that kind of a thing and so
every single example that you put through your network is basically just telling you use these tokens and don't
use these tokens and so the gradients from every single example are actually extremely highly correlated they all
look roughly the same in the in the OR original parts of the optimization because they're all just telling you
that these tokens don't appear and these tokens do appear and so because the gradients are all very similar and
they're highly correlated then why are you doing batch sizes of like Millions when if you do a batch size of 32k
you're basically getting the exact same gradient early on in the training and then later in the optimization once
you've learned all the simple stuff that's where the actual work starts and that's where the gradients become more decorrelated per examples and that's
where they actually offer you sort of statistical power in some sense um so
we're going to skip this just because it kind of complicates things and we're going to go to uh data are sampled without
replacement during training um so until an Epoch boundary is reached so without
replacement means that they're not sampling from some fixed pool and then uh take a sequence train on it but then
also like return the sequence to the pool they are exhausting a pool so when they draw a sequence it's it's gone
until the next Epoch of training uh so we're already doing that because our data loader um iterates over chunks of
data so there's no replacement they don't become eligible to be drawn again until the next P so we're basically
already doing that um all models use a weight decay of
0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization so let's Implement a weight Decay and you see here that I've
already kind of made the changes and in particular instead of creating the optimizer right here um I I'm creating a
new configure optimizers function inside the model and I'm passing in some of the hyper parameters instead so let's look
at the configure optimizers which is supposed to return the optimizer
object okay so it looks complicated but it's actually really simple and it's just um we're just being very careful
and there's a few settings here to go through the most important thing with respect to this line is that you see
there's a weight Decay parameter here and I'm passing that into um well I'm passing that into
something called optim groups that eventually ends up going into the addom W Optimizer um and the weight Decay
that's by default used in Addam W here is 0.01 so it's it's u 10 times lower
than what's used in gpt3 paper here um so the weight dek basically ends up
making its way into the ADD and W through the optimizer groups now what else is going on here in this uh function so the two things that are
happening here that are important is that I'm splitting up the parameters into those that should be weight decayed
and those that should not be weight decayed so in particular it is common to not weight decay uh biases and any other
sort of one-dimensional tensors so the one-dimensional tensors are in the no Decay prams and these are also things
like uh layer Norm scales and biases it doesn't really make sense to weight Decay those you mostly want to weight
Decay uh the weights that participate in Matrix multiplications and you want to potentially weight Decay the
embeddings and uh We've covered in previous video why it makes sense to Decay the weights because you can sort
of the it as a regularization because when you're pulling down all the weights you're forcing the optimization to use
more of the weights um and you're not allowing any one of the weights individually to be way too large um
you're forcing you're forcing the network to kind of like distribute the work across more channels because there's sort of like a pull of gravity
on the weights themselves um so that's why we are separating it in those ways here we're
only decaying the embeddings and the mmal participating ways uh we're printing the number of uh
parameters that we decaying and not most of the parameters will be decayed and then one more thing that we're doing here is I'm doing another optimization
here and previous add and W did not have this option but later parts of pytorch
introduced it and that's why I'm guarding it with an inspect do signature which is basically checking if this
fused um quar is present inside atom W
and then if it is present I'm going to end up using it and passing it in here
because some earlier versions do not have fused equals so here's adamw fused
equals it did not used to exist and it was added later and there's some docks here for what's happening and basically
they say that by default they do not use fused because it is relatively new and we want to give it sufficient big time
so by default they don't use fused but fused is a lot faster when it is available and when you're running on
Cuda and what that does is in instead of iterating in a for Loop over all the
parameter tensors and updating them that would launch a lot of kernels right and so a fused just means that it's a um all
those kernels are fused into a single kernel you get rid of a lot of overhead and you a single time on all the
parameters call a uh kernel that updates them and so it's just basically a kernel
Fusion for the atom W update instead of iterating over all the tensors so that's the configure
optimizers function that I like to use and we can rerun and we're not going to see any major differences from what we
saw before but we are going to see some prints uh coming from here so let's just take a look at what they look
like so we see that number of Decay tensors is 50 and it's most of the parameters and number of non- deay
tensors is 98 and these are the biases and the layer Norm parameters mostly and that's there's only 100,000 of those so
most of it is decayed and then we are using the fused implementation of ATM W which will be a lot faster so if you
have it available I would advise you to use it I'm not actually 100% sure why they don't default to it it seems fairly
benign and harmless and also because we are using the fused implementation I think this is
why we have dropped um notice that the running time used to be 93 milliseconds
per step and we're now down to 90 milliseconds per step because of using the fused atom W Optimizer so in a
single commit here we are introducing fused atom getting improvements on the
time and we're adding or changing the weight Decay but we're only weight decaying the two dimensional parameters
the embeddings and the matrices that participate in linear so that is this
and we can take this out and uh yeah that is it for this line one more quick

当然可以！下面是这一段内容的中文解释：

---

## 🧪 **批量大小变化、权重衰减（weight decay）、Fused AdamW 优化器**

---

### 🚫 1. 为什么我们**不使用**「逐步增大 batch size」？

虽然 GPT-3 训练时用了「**线性增长的 batch size**」策略（从小到大），但这里我们选择 **不使用它**，理由有三：

1. ✅ **实现复杂度高**：每一步的 token 数都变了，很多代码和计算都要调整。
2. 🧠 **优化价值不大**：这是「系统层优化」，不是核心算法优化，对最终精度影响有限。
3. 🎯 **前期梯度几乎一样**：模型一开始是随机的，每个样本给出的梯度都很相似，batch size 大小对梯度平均影响不大。后期优化才真正需要大 batch。

---

### 📚 2. 无放回的数据采样（无重复抽样）

GPT-3 训练时使用「**无放回（without replacement）**」的数据采样策略：

* 意思是一次采样后，不会再用同一数据，直到下一个 epoch
* ✅ 我们的 `DataLoader` 实际上已经是这样的实现，所以无需修改

---

### 🧲 3. 添加权重衰减（weight decay）

#### ✅ GPT-3 设置：

* 使用 `weight_decay = 0.1` 来实现轻微的正则化，防止过拟合

#### ✅ 我们实现逻辑：

1. 新增一个 `configure_optimizers()` 函数来构建优化器
2. 按照 PyTorch 社区推荐，把模型参数分成两类：

   * **需要进行 weight decay 的参数**：

     * 权重矩阵（Linear 层中的 `weight`，Embedding 等）
   * **不需要进行 weight decay 的参数**：

     * Bias（偏置项）
     * LayerNorm 的参数（例如 `weight`, `bias` 也是一维张量）

#### 为什么这么做？

* **衰减 weight** 有助于控制参数规模，防止某些权重值爆炸
* **不衰减 bias / LayerNorm 参数**，因为这些参数数量少、行为特殊，通常不参与正则化

---

### ⚙️ 4. 使用 **Fused AdamW** 优化器（融合版本）

在 PyTorch 的较新版本中，`AdamW` 提供了一个新参数 `fused=True`：

* ✅ **更快**：把对每个参数的更新操作「融合成一个 kernel」，避免频繁的 CUDA kernel 启动
* ✅ **推荐使用**：但需要 PyTorch 支持这个参数（用 `inspect.signature()` 判断是否支持）
* 🔧 默认 PyTorch 并不开启 `fused`，但我们强烈建议在 CUDA 可用时启用它

---

### ⏱️ 5. 效果分析

* 原来每一步运行时间是 **93ms**
* 启用 FusedAdamW 之后是 **90ms**
* 所以我们在引入正则化的同时，也获得了 **≈3% 的速度提升**

---

---

如果你希望我：

* 给出完整的中文注释实现
* 分析权重衰减对 loss 或精度的影响
* 可视化启用/不启用 fused 优化器的性能对比

都可以告诉我\~

好的 👍 这一大段主要讲了 **GPT 训练里的一些优化技巧**：批量大小调度（batch size schedule）、权重衰减（weight decay）、FusedAdamW，以及性能上的提升（90ms → 93ms）。我帮你逐点拆开解释：

---

## 1. Batch size schedule（批量大小调度）

* 思想：**逐步增加 batch size**，一开始用小的 batch size，随着训练进展逐渐放大。
* 原因：

  * 训练早期，模型几乎是随机的，梯度变化高度相关，batch size 开大其实没啥统计学上的好处。
  * 训练后期，模型更稳定，梯度之间差异增大，这时候大 batch size 才能发挥统计平均的优势。
* 作用：**不是优化算法上的改进**，而是 **系统层面（吞吐量、硬件利用率）上的提速技巧**。
* 作者选择 **跳过**，因为这会让计算复杂化（每 step token 数变了，算学习率衰减时很麻烦），收益也不是决定性的。

---

## 2. Weight decay（权重衰减）

* 在 GPT-3 论文中，**所有模型都用 weight decay = 0.1**。
* 在 AdamW 里，weight decay 表现为在更新时对权重加一个“重力”往下拉：

  $$
  w \gets w - \eta \cdot (\nabla L(w) + \lambda w)
  $$

  其中 $\lambda$ 就是 weight decay 系数。
* 作用：

  * 防止权重无限增大，类似正则化。
  * 迫使模型“均匀利用”更多参数，而不是让某些单独的权重过大。
* 实际做法：

  * 不对所有参数都 decay：

    * **不 decay 的参数** → bias、LayerNorm 中的一维参数
    * **要 decay 的参数** → embedding 矩阵、线性层的权重（二维矩阵）

  因为对 bias / LayerNorm scale 做衰减通常没有意义。

---

## 3. FusedAdamW

* **普通 AdamW** 更新流程：对每个参数张量单独调用 CUDA kernel 更新 → 产生很多 kernel launch 开销。
* **FusedAdamW**：把多个更新操作融合成一个 CUDA kernel → 一次性更新所有参数。
* 好处：减少 kernel 调度开销 → 更快。
* 在文中：

  * 普通 AdamW → **93 ms / step**
  * FusedAdamW → **90 ms / step**
  * 虽然只快了一点点，但在大规模训练里（成千上万 GPU，几百亿步）差别非常可观。

---

## 4. 数据采样（without replacement）

* GPT-3 训练时，数据是 **不放回采样**（without replacement）：

  * 一个样本用过，就不会在当前 epoch 再次用到。
  * 下一次 epoch 才会重新进入。
* 这样确保数据不会在短时间内重复，训练更稳定。

---

## 总结一句话

* **Batch size schedule**：早小后大，系统层面加速，但复杂，作者选择跳过。
* **Weight decay**：0.1，正则化效果，应用在权重矩阵/embedding，不对 bias/LayerNorm 做衰减。
* **FusedAdamW**：把优化器更新 kernel 融合，提高 GPU 利用率 → 93ms → 90ms/step。
* **数据采样 without replacement**：每 epoch 覆盖数据一遍，避免短期重复。

---

要不要我帮你画一张图，把 **learning rate schedule**（warmup + cosine decay）和 **batch size schedule** 对比一下，让你直观地看到区别？

```
    def configure_optimizers(self, weight_decay, learning_rate, device):
        # start with all of the candidate parameters (that require grad)
        param_dict = {pn: p for pn, p in self.named_parameters()}
        param_dict = {pn: p for pn, p in param_dict.items() if p.requires_grad}
        # create optim groups. Any parameters that is 2D will be weight decayed, otherwise no.
        # i.e. all weight tensors in matmuls + embeddings decay, all biases and layernorms don't.
        decay_params = [p for n, p in param_dict.items() if p.dim() >= 2]
        nodecay_params = [p for n, p in param_dict.items() if p.dim() < 2]
        optim_groups = [
            {'params': decay_params, 'weight_decay': weight_decay},
            {'params': nodecay_params, 'weight_decay': 0.0}
        ]
        num_decay_params = sum(p.numel() for p in decay_params)
        num_nodecay_params = sum(p.numel() for p in nodecay_params)
        print(f"num decayed parameter tensors: {len(decay_params)}, with {num_decay_params:,} parameters")
        print(f"num non-decayed parameter tensors: {len(nodecay_params)}, with {num_nodecay_params:,} parameters")
        # Create AdamW optimizer and use the fused version if it is available
        fused_available = 'fused' in inspect.signature(torch.optim.AdamW).parameters
        use_fused = fused_available and 'cuda' in device
        print(f"using fused AdamW: {use_fused}")
        optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(optim_groups, lr=learning_rate, betas=(0.9, 0.95), eps=1e-8, fused=use_fused)
        return optimizer
```

这段方法用来**按最佳实践配置 AdamW 优化器**：把需要做 weight decay 的参数和不需要做的分开；能用就启用 **Fused AdamW** 提升速度；并设置 GPT-3 风格的超参。逐行看：

---

### 1) 取出参与训练的参数

```python
param_dict = {pn: p for pn, p in self.named_parameters()}
param_dict = {pn: p for pn, p in param_dict.items() if p.requires_grad}
```

* 收集所有带名字的参数，并**只保留 `requires_grad=True`** 的（冻结的层会被剔除）。

---

### 2) 分组：哪些做 weight decay，哪些不做

```python
decay_params   = [p for n, p in param_dict.items() if p.dim() >= 2]
nodecay_params = [p for n, p in param_dict.items() if p.dim() < 2]
optim_groups = [
    {'params': decay_params,   'weight_decay': weight_decay},
    {'params': nodecay_params, 'weight_decay': 0.0}
]
```

* 经验法则：**二维及以上**（线性/卷积权重矩阵、embedding）→ 做 decay；
  **一维**（bias、LayerNorm/BatchNorm 的 `weight`）→ **不做** decay。
* 这是 Transformer 里常见做法，能提升收敛和泛化。

顺便打印统计，方便核对：

```python
num_decay_params    = sum(p.numel() for p in decay_params)
num_nodecay_params  = sum(p.numel() for p in nodecay_params)
print(f"...")
```

---

### 3) 尝试启用 **Fused AdamW**

```python
fused_available = 'fused' in inspect.signature(torch.optim.AdamW).parameters
use_fused = fused_available and 'cuda' in device
print(f"using fused AdamW: {use_fused}")
```

* 用 `inspect.signature` 检查本机 PyTorch 的 `AdamW` 是否支持 `fused` 参数（较新版本 CUDA 构建才有）。
* 只有在 **CUDA 设备** 上才启用（`'cuda' in device` 的简单判断）。

> 提示：如果 `device` 是 `torch.device('cuda')` 对象而不是字符串，`'cuda' in device` 不生效；更稳妥可用
> `isinstance(device, torch.device) and device.type == 'cuda'` 或直接 `torch.cuda.is_available()`。

---

### 4) 构建优化器（GPT-3 风格超参）

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    optim_groups,
    lr=learning_rate,
    betas=(0.9, 0.95),
    eps=1e-8,
    fused=use_fused
)
return optimizer
```

* **参数分组**传入 AdamW：一组有 `weight_decay`，一组 `0.0`。
* **betas=(0.9, 0.95)**、**eps=1e-8**：参考 GPT-3 论文常用配置。
* `fused=True` 时使用**融合内核**一次性更新多个参数，减少 kernel launch 开销，**更快**。

---

### 小结 & 注意点

* 这套写法 = **正确的 AdamW + 分组 weight decay +（可选）Fused 加速**。
* `p.dim()>=2` 是常用**启发式**：大多数情况正确；若模型里有**特殊一维权重**需要 decay，要单独处理。
* 若你做了**权重共享**（如 `wte.weight = lm_head.weight`），优化器会只维护**一次**参数（同一对象）。
* 混合精度/TF32 与此兼容；梯度裁剪应在 `loss.backward()` 后、`optimizer.step()` 前进行。

# 一维的为什么不做 decay

这是个很经典的问题 👍。在深度学习里，**为什么常见做法是一维参数（bias、LayerNorm/BatchNorm 的 γ/β 等）不做 weight decay**？原因主要有三类：

---

## 1. 数学/正则化角度

* **Weight Decay 本质** ≈ 在目标函数中加入一个 `λ * ||W||²` 的 L2 正则化项。
* 目的是防止权重矩阵无限变大，避免过拟合，同时让多个通道/特征“均衡地”分担工作。
* 这对 **大矩阵/卷积核（dim ≥ 2）** 有意义，因为它们参数多、容量大，很容易“单点爆炸”。

但对 **bias 和归一化层的缩放参数（1D 向量）**：

* **bias**：只是在特征上加个平移，不会导致过拟合能力大幅增加。对它做 L2 正则化意义不大，反而会压制模型去拟合合理的均值偏移。
* **LayerNorm/BatchNorm 的 γ、β**：

  * γ 是缩放因子，β 是平移因子，它们数量非常少（通常只是通道数）。
  * γ 的作用是调节归一化后的激活幅度，如果对它做 decay，等价于强制缩放回接近 1，会 **削弱归一化层的灵活性**。
  * β 就和 bias 一样，只是平移，不影响容量复杂度。

## 2. 实践经验（来自论文和社区经验）

* Transformer、BERT、GPT 系列都遵循这个原则：

  > **“只对权重矩阵（≥2D）和 embedding 做 weight decay，不对 bias、LayerNorm/BatchNorm 做 decay。”**
* 这是因为实验证明：

  * 如果对一维参数也做 decay，收敛会变慢甚至性能下降。
  * 不做 decay 的收敛更稳定。

---

## 3. 直观理解

你可以这么想：

* **Weight Decay** ≈ “重力”，拉着大权重往 0 收缩。
* 对“大块头”（矩阵权重）用这个重力 → 防止它们长得太大。
* 对“小角色”（bias、缩放参数）用这个重力 → 会让它们失去灵活调节特征分布的能力，反而坏事。

---

✅ 总结：
**一维参数（bias、LayerNorm/BatchNorm 的 γ/β）通常不做 weight decay**，因为它们参数少、功能是平移/缩放，不会导致过拟合；对它们做 decay 反而限制模型表达能力和训练稳定性。

---

要不要我帮你画一个 **示意图**，展示矩阵权重和一维参数在训练中各自的“角色”和为什么一个需要收缩、一个不需要？


# gradient accumulation

note before we continue here I just want to point out that the relationship between weight Decay learning rate batch
size the atom parameters beta 1 beta 2 the Epsilon and so on these are very complicated uh mathematical
relationships in the optimization literature and um for the most part I'm
in this video I'm just trying to copy paste the settings that open AI used but this is a complicated topic uh quite
deep and um yeah in this video I just want to copy the parameters because it's a whole different video to really talk
about that in detail and give it a proper Justice instead of just high level intuitions uh now the next thing that I
want to move on to is that uh this paragraph here by the way we're going to turn back around to when we improve our
data loader for now I want to swing back around to this
table where you will notice that um for different models we of course have
different U hyper parameters for the Transformer that dictate the size of the Transformer Network we also have a
different learning rate so we're seeing the pattern that the bigger networks are trained with slightly lower learning rates and we also see this batch size
where in in the small networks they use a smaller batch size and in the bigger networks they use a bigger batch size
now the problem with for us is we can't just use 0.5 million batch size because
uh if I just try to come in here and I try to set uh this uh B where is my
b um b
equals where where do I call the DAT okay b equal 16 if I try to set um
well well we have to be careful it's not 0.5 million because this is the badge size in the number of tokens every
single one of our rows is24 tokens so 0.5 E6 1 million divide 1024 this would
need about a 488 match size so the problem is I can't come in here and set this to 488 uh
because my GPU would explode um this would not fit for sure and so but we
still want to use this batch size because again as I mentioned the batch size is correlated with all the other
optimization hyper parameters and the learning rates and so on so we want to have a faithful representation of all
the hyper parameters and therefore we need to uh use a bat size of .5 million
roughly but the question is how do we use .5 million if we only have a small GPU well for that we need to use what's
called gradient accumulation uh so we're going to turn to that next and it allows us to simulate in a Serial way any
arbitrary batch size that we set and so we can do a batch size of .5 million we
just have to run longer and we have to process multiple sequences and basically
add up all the gradients from them to simulate a batch size of .5 million so let's turn to that next okay so I
started the implementation right here just by adding these lines of code and basically what I did is first I set the
total batch size that we desire so this is exactly .5 million and I used a nice
number a power of two uh because 2 to the 19 is 524 288 so it's roughly .5
million it's a nice number now our micro batch size as we call it now is 16 so
this is going to be we still have B BYT in the SE that go into the Transformer
and do forward backward but we're not going to do an update right we're going to do many forward backwards we're going
to and those gradients are all going to plus equals on the parameter gradients they're all going to add up so we're
going to do forward backward grad akum steps number of times and then we're going to do a single update once all
that is accumulated so in particular our micro batch size is just now controlling how
many tokens how many rows we're processing in a single go over a forward backward so um here we are doing 16 *
124 we're doing 16 384 um tokens per forward backward and
we are supposed to be doing 2 to the 19 whoops what am I doing 2 to the
19 in total so the grat Aon will be
32 uh so therefore gr AUM here will work out to 32 and we have to do 32 forward
backward um and then a single update now we see that we have about 100 milliseconds for a singer forward
backward so doing 32 of them will be will make every step roughly 3 seconds
just napkin math so that's grum steps but now we actually have to Implement that so we're
going to swing over to our training Loop because now this part
here and this part here the forward and the backward we have to now repeat this 32 times before we do everything else
that follows so let's uh see how we can Implement that so let's come over here and actually we do have to load a new
batch every single time so let me move that over here and now this is where we have the inner loop so for micro step in
range graum steps we do this and remember that l.
backward always deposits gradients so we're doing inside losta backward there's always a plus equals on the
gradients so in every single L of backward gradients will add up on the gradient
tensors um so we lost that backward and then we get all the gradients over there
and then we normalize and everything else should just follow um so we're very
close but actually there's like subtle and deep issue here and this is actually
incorrect so invite I invite you to think about why this is not yet sufficient um and uh let me fix it then
okay so I brought back the jupyter notebook so we can think about this carefully in a simple toy setting and
see what's happening so let's create a very simple neural nut that takes a 16 Vector of 16 numbers and returns a
single number and then here I'm creating some random uh examples X and some targets uh
y Y and then we are using the mean squared loss uh here to calculate the
loss so basically what this is is four individual examples and we're just doing
Simple regression with the mean squared loss over those four examples now when we calculate the loss
and we lost that backward and look at the gradient this is the gradient that we achieve now the loss objective here
notice that in MSE loss the default for the loss function is reduction is mean
so we're we're calculating the average mean loss um the the mean loss here over
the four examples so this is the exact loss objective and this is the average
the one over four because there are four independent examples here and then we have the four examples and their mean
squared error the squared error and then this makes it the mean squared error so
therefore uh we are we calculate the squared error and then we normalize it to make it the mean over the examples
and there's four examples here so now when we come to the gradient accumulation version of it this uh this
here is the gradient accumulation version of it where we have grad acum steps of four and I reset the gradient
we've grum steps of four and now I'm evaluating all the examples individually instead and calling L that backward on
them many times and then we're looking at the gradient that we achieve from that so basically now we forward our
function calculate the exact same loss do a backward and we do that four times
and when we look at the gradient uh you'll notice that the gradients don't match so here we uh did a single batch
of four and here we did uh four gradient accumulation steps of batch size one and
the gradients are not the same and basically the the reason that they're not the same is exactly because this
mean squared error gets lost this one quarter in this loss gets lost because what happens here is the loss of
objective for every one of the loops is just a mean squ error um which in this
case because there's only a single example is just this term here so that was the loss in the zeroth eration same
in the first third and so on and then when you do the loss. backward we're accumulating gradients and what happens
is that accumulation in the gradient is basically equivalent to doing a sum in
the loss so our loss actually here is this
without the factor of one quarter outside of it so we're missing the normalizer and therefore our gradients
are off and so the way to fix this or one of them is basically we can actually come here and we can say loss equals
loss divide 4 and what happens now is that we're introducing we're we're scaling our loss
we're introducing a one quarter in front of all of these
places so all the individual losses are now scaled by one quarter and and then when we backward all of these accumulate
with a sum but now there's a one quarter inside every one of these components and now our losses will be
equivalent so when I run this you see that the U gradients are now identical
so long story short with this simple example uh when you step through it you can see that basically the reason that
this is not correct is because in the same way as here in the MSE loss the
loss that we're calculating here in the model is using a reduction of mean as
well uh so where's the loss after that cross entropy and by default the reduction uh
here in Cross entropy is also I don't know why they don't show it but it's the mean uh the mean uh loss at all the B
BYT elements right so there's a reduction by mean in
there and if we're just doing this gradient accumulation here we're missing that and so the way to fix this is to
simply compensate for the number of gradient accumulation steps and we can in the same way divide this loss so in
particular here the number of steps that we're doing is loss equals loss divide
gradient accumulation steps so even uh co-pilot s gets the modification but in
the same way exactly we are scaling down the loss so that when we do loss that backward which basically corresponds to
a sum in the objective we are summing up the already normalized um loss and and therefore
when we sum up the losses divided by grum steps we are recovering the additional normalizer uh and so now
these two will be now this will be equivalent to the original uh sort of optimization because the gradient will
come out the same okay so I had to do a few more touch-ups and I launched launched the optimization here so in
particular one thing we want to do because we want to print things nicely is well first of all we need to create
like an accumulator over the loss we can't just print the loss because we'd be printing only the final loss at the
final micro step so instead we have loss ofon which I initialize at zero and then I accumulate a uh the loss into it and
I'm using detach so that um uh I'm detaching the tensor uh from the graph
and I'm just trying to keep track of the values so I'm making these Leaf nodes when I add them so that's lakum and then
we're printing that here instead of loss and then in addition to that I had to account for the grum steps inside the
tokens processed because now the tokens processed per step is B * T * gradient
accumulation so long story short here we have the optimization it looks uh
reasonable right we're starting at a good spot we calculated the grum steps to be 32 and uh we're getting about 3 seconds
here right um and so this looks pretty good now if
you'd like to verify that uh your optimization and the implementation here is correct and your working on a side
well now because we have the total patch size and the gradient accumulation steps our setting of B is purely a performance
optimization kind of setting so if you have a big GPU you can actually increase this to 32 and you'll probably go a bit
faster if you have a very small GPU you can try eight or four but in any case you should be getting the exact same
optimization and the same answers up to like a floating Point error because the gradient accumulation kicks in and um
and can um handle everything serially as an Neary so uh that's it for gradient
accumulation I think okay so now is the time to bring out the heavy weapons uh you've noticed that so far we've only

当然可以！以下是关于「梯度累积（gradient accumulation）」的中文解释：

---

## 🧠 **梯度累积：解决小显存也能模拟大 batch 的技巧**

---

### 📌 问题背景

在 GPT-3 论文中，作者使用了 **超大的 batch size（如 50 万个 token）** 来训练模型。但问题是：

* 🧨 **我们显卡显存小**，不能一次性塞进这么多 token；
* 🧪 **我们又想用一样的 batch size**，来模拟 GPT-3 的超大训练设置；
* ✅ **解决方案就是「梯度累积」**（Gradient Accumulation）。

---

### 🧩 梯度累积的原理

* 把一个大 batch（如 50 万 tokens）分成多个小批（如每次 16 个 batch）：

  * 每次 **forward + backward** 但**不更新权重**
  * 多次累加梯度
  * **累加 N 次之后再更新一次权重**

**举个例子：**

* 目标总 batch size = `524288`（约等于 50 万，选了个 2 的幂，方便 CUDA 优化）
* 每次处理一个「微小批」`B = 16`，每个样本长度 `T = 1024`，则每轮处理 `16 × 1024 = 16384` tokens
* 为了累计到 524288 个 token：

  * `524288 ÷ 16384 = 32`
  * 所以我们需要 **32 次 forward + backward 才更新一次权重**

这就是 `gradient_accumulation_steps = 32`

---

### ⚠️ 小细节：loss 要除以累积步数

这里有一个很容易出错的细节：

* 通常我们的 loss 是 `mean`，比如 `CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='mean')`
* 如果我们做 32 次 `loss.backward()`，其实是把每一步的梯度 **直接相加了**
* 那等于损失函数从「平均值」变成了「总和」了！❌

所以，**每次都要把 loss 除以 `gradient_accumulation_steps`**，才能得到等效的梯度：

```python
loss = loss / gradient_accumulation_steps
loss.backward()
```

这样累积出来的梯度与「一次大 batch 的梯度」完全等价 ✅

---

### 🖨️ 其他代码改动

1. 累计 loss 用来打印，不能只打印最后一次的：

   ```python
   loss_accum += loss.detach()
   ```

2. token 数的统计也要乘上累积步数：

   ```python
   tokens += B * T * gradient_accumulation_steps
   ```

3. 外层 loop 每次做一次完整的 32 次累积更新

---

### 💡 梯度累积的作用总结

| 功能                | 描述                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 模拟大 batch         | 用小显卡实现大模型训练                           |
| 保持学习率等超参数不变       | 更贴近 GPT-3 等大型模型的优化设置                  |
| 与「一次性大 batch」结果相同 | 除了浮点误差外，最终效果是等价的                      |
| 可调节 B 值做性能优化      | 有大 GPU 就调大 B，有小 GPU 就调小 B，但优化结果保持一致 ✅ |

---

如果你还想进一步可视化：

* **不使用梯度累积 vs 使用梯度累积** 的训练曲线对比
* 调整 `B` 或 `accum_steps` 对训练稳定性的影响

我也可以帮你展示！🌟

好的，这一大段内容的核心就是 **Gradient Accumulation（梯度累积）**。我给你梳理一下重点，并分层次解释：

---

## 🔑 背景问题

* **大模型训练需要超大的 batch size**（比如 50 万 tokens 一次）。
* 但是 **单卡 GPU 显存有限**，根本放不下这么大的 batch。
* 怎么办？——用 **梯度累积** 来“模拟”大 batch。

---

## ⚙️ 梯度累积（Gradient Accumulation）的基本原理

### 1. 正常训练

训练时，我们的循环是这样的：

```python
for step in range(max_steps):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    logits, loss = model(x, y)
    loss.backward()       # 计算梯度（累加到参数 .grad 上）
    optimizer.step()      # 参数更新
```

这里一个 step 就等于一个 batch 的前向、反向和更新。

---

### 2. 显存不够时（梯度累积思路）

如果 batch 太大，放不进 GPU，我们可以：

* 把它 **拆成多个小 batch（micro-batch）**。
* 每个 micro-batch 做 **forward + backward**，梯度会自动累加到 `.grad` 里（PyTorch 默认是 +=）。
* 但 **暂时不调用 `optimizer.step()`**。
* 当累积了 N 个 micro-batch 后，才做一次参数更新。

这样一来：

```
大 batch = N × 小 batch
```

就模拟出了大 batch 的效果。

---

### 3. 为什么要除以 `grad_accum_steps`

这里有一个坑点：

* `loss.backward()` 默认对 loss 的 **均值 (mean)** 进行反向传播。
* 如果你累积了 32 次小 batch，每次 loss 都是平均的，但你直接相加，实际上会放大 32 倍。
* 正确做法：**在反向传播前，把 loss 除以累积步数**：

```python
loss = loss / grad_accum_steps
loss.backward()
```

这样每次累加的梯度是缩放过的，最终效果和一次性跑大 batch 一致。

---

## 📊 小例子

假设：

* 想要的 batch size = 64
* GPU 只能放下 batch size = 16
* 那么：

  * `grad_accum_steps = 64 / 16 = 4`
  * 每 4 个小 batch 之后更新一次参数。

代码大概是：

```python
grad_accum_steps = 4
optimizer.zero_grad()
for micro_step in range(grad_accum_steps):
    x, y = next(data_iter)               # 取一个 micro batch
    logits, loss = model(x, y)
    (loss / grad_accum_steps).backward() # 缩放损失，累积梯度
optimizer.step()
```

---

## 🧠 关键理解

1. **为什么要梯度累积？**

   * 为了在显存有限的情况下模拟更大的 batch size，提升稳定性。
   * 大 batch size 通常需要调整学习率、weight decay 等超参数。

2. **为什么要对 loss 缩放？**

   * 因为 `loss.backward()` 本质是“把 loss 对参数的梯度求出来并加到 .grad 上”。
   * 如果不缩放，等价于“做了 N 次 sum”，而不是一次 mean。
   * 这会让梯度变大 N 倍，训练发散。

3. **计算开销**

   * 时间会变慢（要多次 forward/backward），但显存压力大大减小。
   * 本质是用 **时间换空间**。

---

✅ **一句话总结：**
**Gradient Accumulation = 用多个小 batch 的梯度累加，来模拟一个大 batch 的训练效果。**
关键点是要在 `.backward()` 前对 loss 除以累积步数，否则梯度会放大。

---

要不要我帮你画一个 **对比流程图**（一次大 batch vs 多次小 batch + 梯度累积），这样直观展示区别？

```
import torch

# super simple little MLP
net = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(16, 32),
    torch.nn.GELU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)
)
torch.random.manual_seed(42)
x = torch.randn(4, 16)
y = torch.randn(4, 1)
net.zero_grad()
yhat = net(x)
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat, y)
loss.backward()
print(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])
```

好，这段代码是一个 **PyTorch 的最小化示例**，演示了如何构建一个小的 MLP、计算损失、做一次反向传播，并查看梯度。逐行拆解一下：

---

### 代码解析

```python
import torch
```

导入 PyTorch。

---

```python
# super simple little MLP
net = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(16, 32),
    torch.nn.GELU(),
    torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)
)
```

这里定义了一个 **顺序模型（MLP，多层感知机）**：

* `torch.nn.Linear(16, 32)`：输入 16 维 → 输出 32 维。
* `torch.nn.GELU()`：激活函数。
* `torch.nn.Linear(32, 1)`：输入 32 维 → 输出 1 维（一个标量回归）。

整体结构：
**16 → 32 → GELU → 1**

---

```python
torch.random.manual_seed(42)
```

设置随机数种子，保证每次运行结果一致（权重初始化、输入样本都一样）。

---

```python
x = torch.randn(4, 16)
y = torch.randn(4, 1)
```

生成数据：

* `x`：shape = `(4, 16)`，4 个样本，每个样本 16 维。
* `y`：shape = `(4, 1)`，4 个回归目标值。

---

```python
net.zero_grad()
```

清空网络中所有参数的梯度（否则梯度会累积）。

---

```python
yhat = net(x)
```

前向传播：

* `net(x)` 把输入 `x` 喂给 MLP，得到预测值 `yhat`，形状 `(4, 1)`。

---

```python
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat, y)
```

计算 **均方误差损失 (MSE loss)**：

$$
\text{loss} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i (yhat_i - y_i)^2
$$

---

```python
loss.backward()
```

**反向传播**：

* 自动计算 loss 对每个参数的梯度。
* 梯度会存放在 `param.grad` 里。

---

```python
print(net[0].weight.grad.view(-1)[:10])
```

取出 **第一层的权重矩阵的梯度**：

* `net[0]` 就是第一个 `Linear(16, 32)` 层。
* `weight` 是形状 `(32, 16)` 的矩阵。
* `.grad` 是同样大小的梯度矩阵。
* `.view(-1)` 把它摊平成一维向量。
* `[:10]` 打印前 10 个元素。

---

### 总结

这段代码做的事情是：

1. 定义一个小 MLP。
2. 随机生成 4 个输入样本和目标。
3. 前向传播 → 得到预测。
4. 计算 MSE 损失。
5. 反向传播 → 得到第一层权重的梯度。
6. 打印梯度的前 10 个数。

---

💡 用一句话来说：**这是一个最简示例，展示了“前向 + 损失 + 反向传播 + 查看梯度”的完整训练步骤**。

要不要我帮你画个图，把 **数据流动（前向）** 和 **梯度流动（反向）** 在这个小 MLP 里标出来？这样更直观。


# loss.detach() 解释一下

好问题 👍。我们来看 **`loss.detach()`** 在 PyTorch 里的作用。

---

### 背景

在 PyTorch 里，**Tensor 有两种形态**：

* 普通张量（不追踪梯度）
* 计算图里的张量（`requires_grad=True`，会记录它是由哪些操作计算得到的）

比如：

```python
loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(yhat, y)
```

这里的 `loss` 是一个 **标量 Tensor**，它属于计算图的一部分，和 `yhat`、`net` 的参数都有关联。
这样当你调用 `loss.backward()` 时，PyTorch 就能根据 `loss` 的计算图，去算出所有参数的梯度。

---

### `detach()` 的作用

`loss.detach()` 会：

1. **切断计算图** —— 返回一个新 Tensor，它有相同的数值，但不再跟踪梯度。
2. **停止反向传播** —— 这个新 Tensor 不会再往前传递梯度。

举个例子：

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
loss = y.sum()

print(loss.requires_grad)  # True，因为它依赖于 x
loss_detached = loss.detach()
print(loss_detached.requires_grad)  # False
```

---

### 为什么要用 `detach()`？

常见用途有：

1. **记录或打印 loss**

   ```python
   running_loss += loss.detach()
   ```

   这样不会把 `running_loss` 变成计算图的一部分（避免显存泄漏）。

2. **避免梯度传播**
   比如你想在训练时，用 `loss` 的数值做一些统计或 log，但是这些操作不应该影响梯度，就要先 `detach()`。

3. **冻结部分网络**
   如果你只想用某个子网络的输出当作常量输入另一个网络，不希望反向传播进去，可以 `detach()`。

   ```python
   with torch.no_grad():
       features = backbone(x)  # 或者 backbone(x).detach()
   ```

---

### 总结一句话

`loss.detach()` 的意思是：**得到 loss 的数值副本，不再追踪梯度，也不会参与反向传播**。

---

要不要我给你写个**小实验**，演示如果不用 `detach`，会导致 `running_loss` 里“偷偷积累计算图”，从而显存爆炸的情况？



# distributed data parallel (DDP)

been using a single GPU for training but actually I am paying for eight gpus here
and so uh we should be putting all of them to work and in particular they are going to collaborate and uh you know
optimize over tokens at the same time and communicate so that um uh they're
all kind of collaborating on the optimization for this we are going to be using the distributed data parallel from
pytorch there's also a legacy data parallel which I recommend you not use and that's kind of like you know Legacy
distributed data parallel Works in a very simple way we have eight gpus so we're going to uh launch eight processes
and each process is going to be assigned to GPU and for each process the training
Loop and everything we've worked on so far is going to look pretty much the same H GPU as far as it's concerned is
just working on exactly what we've built so far but now Secret L there's eight of them and they're all going to be
processing slightly different parts of the data and we're going to add one more
part where once they all calculate their gradients there's one more part where we do a average of those
gradients and so that's how they're going to be collaborating on uh the computational workload here so to use
all eight of them we're not going to be launching our script anymore with just um pytorch train
gbt2 piy we're going to be running it with a special command called torrun in pytorch we'll see that in a bit and
torrun uh when it runs our python script we'll actually make sure to run eight eight of them in parallel and it creates
these environmental variables where each of these processes can look up which uh
basically which one of the processes it is so for example torron will set rank
local Rank and World size environmental variables and so this is a bad way to
detect whether uh DDP is running so if we're using torch run if DDP is
running then uh we have to make sure that K is available because I don't know that you can run this on CPU anymore or
that that makes sense to do um this is some um setup code here the important
part is that there's a world size which for us will be eight that's the total number of processes running there's a
rank which is um each process will basically run the ex exact same code at
the exact same time roughly but all the process the only difference between these processes is that they all have a
different dtp rank so the um gpu0 will have DDP rank of zero GPU 1 will have uh
rank of one Etc so otherwise they're all running the exact same script it's just
that DDP rank will be a slightly different integer and that is the way for us to coordinate that they don't for
example run on the same data we want to we want them to run on different parts of the data and so on
now local rank is something that is only used in a multi- node setting we only have a single node with ag gpus and so
local rank is the rank of the GPU on a single node so from 0 to seven as an
example but for us we're mostly going to be running on a single box so the things we care about are Rank and World size
this is eight and this will be whatever it is depending on the GPU uh that uh that this particular instantiation of
the script runs on now here we make sure that according to
the local rank we are setting the device to be Cuda colon and colon indicates
which GPU to use if there are more than one gpus so depending on the local rank
of this process it's going to use just the appropriate GPU so there's no collisions on which GPU is being used by
which process and finally there's a Boolean variable that I like to create which is the DDP rank equ equal Z so the master
process is arbitrarily process number zero and it does a lot of the printing logging checkpointing Etc and the other
processes are thought of mostly as a compute processes that are assisting and so Master process zero will have some
additional work to do all the other processes will uh will mostly just be doing forward backwards and if we're not using DDP and
none of these variables are set we revert back to single GPU training so that means that we only have rank zero
the world size is just one uh and and we are the master process and we try to autodetect the device and this is world
as normal so so far all we've done is we've initialized DDP and uh in the case where we're
running with torrun which we'll see in a bit there's going to be eight copies running in parallel each one of them
will have a different Rank and now we have to make sure that everything happens uh correctly afterwards so the
tricky thing with running multiple processes is you always have to imagine that there's going to be eight processes
running in parallel so as you read the code now you have to imagine there's eight you know eight python interpreters
running down these lines of code and the only difference between them is that they have a different DDP rank so they
all come here they all pick the exact same seed they all make all of these calculations completely unaware of the
other copies running roughly speaking right so they all make the exact same calculations and now we have to adjust
these calculations to take into account that there's actually like a certain world size and certain ranks so in
particular these micro batches and sequence lengths these are all just per GPU right so now there's going to be num
processes of them running in parallel so we have to adjust this right because the
grum steps now is going to be total B size divide B * T time U DDP R
size because each um process will will
do B * T and there's this many of them and so in addition to that we we
want to make sure that this fits nicely into total batch size which for us it will because 16 * 124 * 8 8 gpus is
131 uh K and so 524288 this means that our gratum will
be four with the current settings right so there's going to be 16 * 124 process
on each GPU and then there's a GP pus so we're going to be doing 131,000 tokens in a single forward
backward on the 8 gpus so we want to make sure that this
fits nicely so that we can derive a nice gradient accumulation steps and uh yeah let's just adjust the
comments here times uh DDP World size okay so each GPU calculates this now
this is where we start to get run into issues right so we are each process is going to come by a print and they're all
going to print so we're going to have eight copies of these prints so one way to deal with this is exactly this master
process variable that we have so if Master process then guard this and
that's just so that we just print this a single time because otherwise all the processes would have computed the exact same variables and there's no need to
print this eight times um before getting into the data loader and we're going to have to
refactor it obviously maybe at this point is uh we should do some prints and
uh just take it out for a spin and exit at this point so import
sis and S start exit and print IM
GPU um DDP
rank IM GPU DDP Rank and that um print
by so uh so now let's try to run this and just see how this works so let's
take it for a spin just so we see what it looks like so normally we use to launch python train gpd2 P like this now
we're going to run with torch run and this is what it looks like so torch run Standalone number of processes for
example is eight for us because we have eight gpus uh and then change of2 Pi so
this is what the command would look like and torch run again we'll run eight of these so let's just see what happens so
first it gets a little busy so there's a lot going on here so first of all there's
some warnings from distributed and I don't actually know that these mean anything I think this is just like the
code is setting up and the processes are coming online and we're seeing some preliminary failure to collect while the
processes come up I'm not 100% sure about that but we start to then get into
actual prints so all the processes went down and then the first print actually comes from
process 5 uh just by chance and then it printed so process 5 basically got here
first it said I'm process on GPU 5 buy and then this these prints come from the
master process so process 5 just finished first for whatever reason it just depends on
how the operating system scheduled the processes to run uh then gpu0 ended then GPU 3 and two and then uh probably
process 5 or something like that has uh exited and and DDP really doesn't like
that because we didn't properly dispose of uh the multi-gpus um setting and so
process group has not been destroyed before we destruct uh so it really doesn't like that and in an actual
application we would want to call destroy process group uh so that we clean up DDP properly and so it doesn't
like that too much and then the rest of the gpus finish and that's it so
basically we can't guarantee when these processes are running it's totally but they are running in parallel we
don't want them to be printing um and next up let's erase
this next up we want to make sure that when we create data loader light we need to now make it aware of this
multi-process um setting because we don't want all the processes to be loading the exact same data we want
every process to get its own chunk of data so that they're all working on different parts of the data set of course so let's adjust that so one
particular particularly simple and a naive way to do this is we have to make sure that we pass in the rank and the
size to the data loader and then when we come up here we see that we now take Rank and processes
and we save them now the current position will not be zero uh because
what we want is we want to stride out all the processes so one way to do this
is we basically take S.B times salt. T and then multiply it by the process
rank so proc process rank 0 will start at zero but process rank one now starts
at B * T process rank two is starts at 2 * B * D Etc so that is the
initialization now we still they still do this identically but now when we
advance we don't Advance by B * T we advance by B * T times number of
processes right so basically um the total number of tokens that we're um
consuming is B * T * number processes and they all go off to a different Rank
and the position has to advance by the entire chunk and then here B * T time uh s. num
processes + one would be to exceed number of tokens then we're going to Loop and when we Loop we want to of
course Loop in the exact same way so we sort of like reset back uh so this is
the simplest change that I can uh find for kind of a very simple distributed data Lo light and um you can notice that
if process rank is zero and non processes is one then uh the whole thing will be identical to what we had before
but now we can have actually multiple processes uh running and this should work fine um so that's the data loader okay
so next up once they've all initialized the data loader they come here and they all create a GPT model uh so we create
eight GPT models on eight processes but because the seeds are fixed here they all create the same identical model they
all move it to the device of their Rank and they all compile the model and because the models are identical there
are eight identical compilations happening in parallel but that's okay now none of this uh changes because that
is on a per step basis and we're currently working kind of within step because we need to um just uh all the
all the changes we're making are kind of like a within step changes now the important thing here is
when we construct the M model we actually have a bit of work to to do here get loits is deprecated so uh
create model we need to actually wrap the model into the distributed data parallel
container so um this is how we wrap the model into the DDP container and these
are the docs for DDP and they're quite extensive and there's a lot of caveats and a lot of things to be careful with
because everything complexifies times 10 when multiple processes are involved but
roughly speaking this device IDs I believe has to be passed in now unfortunately the docs for what device
IDs is is is extremely unclear uh so when you actually like come here this
comment for what device IDs is is roughly nonsensical um but I'm pretty sure it's
supposed to be the DDP local rank so not the DDP rank the local rank uh so this
is what you pass in here this wraps the model and in particular what DDP does for you is in a forward pass it actually
behaves identically so um my understanding of it is nothing should be changed in the forward pass but in the
backward pass as you are doing the backward pass um in the simpl setting
once the backp passes over on each independent GPU each independent GPU has
the gradient for all the parameters and what DDP does for you is once the backward pass is over it will call
what's called all reduce and it basically does an average across all the
uh ranks of their gradients and and then it will deposit that average on every
single rank so every sing Single rank will end up with the average on it and so basically that's the communication it
just synchronizes and averages the gradients and that's what DDP offers you now DDP actually is a little bit more um
it is a little bit more involved than that because as you are doing the backward pass through the layers of the Transformer it actually can dispatch
Communications for the gradient while the backward pass is still happening so there's overlap of the uh communication
of the gradient and the synchronization of them and uh the backward pass and uh this is just more efficient and um uh to
do it that way so that's what DDP does for you um forward is unchanged and
backward is mostly unchanged and we're tacking on this average as we'll see in a bit okay so now let's go to the uh
optimization nothing here changes let's go to the optimization here the inner loop and think through the
synchronization of uh these gradients in the DP so basically by default what happens as I mentioned is when you do l.
backward here it will do the backward pass and then it will synchronize the gradients um the problem here is because
of the gradient accumulation steps Loop here we don't actually want to do the
synchronization after every single La step backward because we are just depositing gradients and we're doing
that serially and we just want them adding up and we don't want to synchronize every single time that would be extremely wasteful so basically we
want to add them up and then on the the very last uh it's only on the very last step when micro when micro step becomes
gratak steps minus one only at that last step do we want to actually do the
alberu uh to average up the gradients so to do that we come here and um the
official sanctioned way by the way is to do this no sync context manager so
pytorch says this is a context manager to disable gradient synchronization across DDP processes So within this
context gradient will be accumulated and basically when you do no sync there will be no communication so
they are telling us to do with DDP no sync uh do the gradient accumulation accumulate grats and then they are
asking us to do DDP again with another input and that backward and I just really don't love this I I just really
don't like it uh the fact that you have to copy paste your code here and use a context manager and this is just super
ugly so when I went to this source code here you can see that when you enter
you simply toggle this variable this require backward grat sync and this is
uh being toggled around and changed and this is the variable that basically uh
if you step through it is being toggled to determine if the gradient is going to be synchronized so I actually just kind
of like to use that directly uh so instead what I like to do is the
following right here before the L back backward if we are using the DDP then um
then basically we only want to synchronize we only want this variable to be true when it is the final
iteration in all the other iterations inside the micr steps we want to be false so I just toggle it like this so
required backward graph sync should only turn on when the micro step is the last step and so I'm toggling this variable
directly and I hope that that impacts last St backwards and this is a naughty thing to do
because you know they could probably change the DDP and this variable will go away but for now I believe this this
works and it allows me to avoid the use of context managers and code duplication I'm just toggling the variable and then
Lop backward will not synchronize most of the steps and it will synchronize the very last step and so once this is over
uh and we come out every single um rank will suddenly magically have the average
of all the gradients that were stored on all the ranks so now we have to think
through whether that is what we want and also um if this suffices and whether how
it works with the loss and what is loss AUM so let's think through through that now and the problem I'm getting at is
that we've averaged the gradients which is great but the loss AUM has not been impacted yet and the and this is outside
of the DDP container so that is not being averaged um and so here when when we are printing Los AUM well presumably
we're only going to be printing on the master process uh rank zero and it's just going to be printing the losses
that it saw on its process but instead we want it to print the loss over all
the processes and the average of that loss because we did average of gradients so we want the average of loss as well
so simply here after this uh this is the code that I've used in the past um and
instead of LF we want Lum so if
DDP again then this is a p torch distributed I import it where do I
import it uh oh gosh so this file is starting
to get out of control huh so if uh so import torch. distributed as dist
so dist. ALU and we're doing the average on Lum
and so this lakum tensor exists on all the ranks when we call all use of average it creates the average of those
numbers and it deposits that average on all the ranks so all the ranks after this um call will now contain L AUM uh
averaged up and so when we print here on the master process the L AUM is identical in all the other ranks as well
so here if Master process oops we want to print like this okay and
finally we have to be careful because we're not processing even more tokens so times DDP World size
that's number of tokens that we've processed up above
and everything else should be fine uh the only other thing to be careful with is as I mentioned you want to destroy
the process group so that we are nice to nickel and it's not going to uh to uh to DDP and it's not going to complain to us
uh when we exit here so that should be it let's try to take it for a spin okay so I launched
the script and it should be uh printing here imminently we're now training with 8 gpus at the same time so the gradient
accumulation steps is not 32 it is now divide 8 and it's just four uh so um
otherwise this is what the optimization now looks like and wow we're going really fast so we're processing 1.5
million tokens uh per second now so these are some serious numbers and the
tiny shakespare data set is so tiny that we're just doing like so many Epoch over it most likely but this is roughly what
looks like um one thing that I had to fix by the way is that this was model.
configure optimizers which Now doesn't work because model now is a DDP model so instead this has to become raw
model. configure optimizers where raw model is something I create here so
right after I wrap the model into DDP uh I have to create the raw model which in
the case of DDP is a model. module is where it stores the raw and then module
of gpt2 as we have it which contains the uh configure optimizers function that we want to call so that's one thing that I
have to fix otherwise this seems to run now one thing you'll notice is that when you actually compare this run and the
numbers in it to the just running a single GPU you'll notice that this is single GPU run with 32 gratum the
numbers won't exactly match up and uh that's kind of a boring reason for why that happens uh the reason for
that is that in the data loader we're basically just iterating through batches and slightly different way because now
we're looking for an entire page of data and if that page uh for all the gpus if
that chunk exceeds the number of tokens we just Loop and so actually the single GPU and the H GPU process will end up um
resetting in a slightly different Manner and so our batches are slightly different and so we get slightly
different numbers but one way to convince yourself that this is okay it just make the total batch size much
smaller and the b and a t and then um so I think I used uh 4 * 124 * 8 so I
used 32768 as a total patch size and then um so I made sure that the single
GPU will do eight creting accumulation steps and then the multi-gpu and then you're reducing the boundary effects of
the data loader and you'll see that the numbers match up so long story short we're now going really really fast the
optimization is mostly consistent with gpt2 and three hyper parameters and uh
we have outgrown our tiny Shakespeare file and we want to upgrade it so let's move to next to that next so let's now

这段文字描述了如何使用 PyTorch 的分布式数据并行（DDP）来加速模型训练，尤其是在多 GPU 环境下。以下是中文总结：

### **1. 分布式数据并行简介：**

* **单 GPU 训练：** 在单 GPU 上训练时，模型的训练过程就是单线程运行的，所有计算都在一个设备上进行。
* **多 GPU 训练：** 现在使用了 8 个 GPU，因此需要让这些 GPU 协同工作进行优化。PyTorch 提供了 **Distributed Data Parallel（DDP）** 来实现这一目标。DDP 通过将训练过程拆分成多个进程，每个进程分配给一个 GPU，这些进程并行执行，但它们计算的梯度会被同步和平均。

### **2. 启动训练：**

* **torch.run**：为了启动分布式训练，我们不再通过传统的 `python train.py` 来启动，而是使用 `torch run` 命令，它会并行启动多个进程，并为每个进程设置必要的环境变量（例如 rank 和 world size）。

  * **rank**：表示当前进程在 8 个 GPU 中的编号。
  * **world size**：表示总共参与训练的进程数。
  * **local rank**：用于在多节点训练中标识当前节点上的 GPU 编号。

### **3. 数据加载器的调整：**

* **分布式数据加载：** 由于我们有多个进程并行工作，所以每个进程需要加载不同的数据部分。需要通过 `rank` 和 `world size` 来调整数据加载器，使每个进程处理不同的数据块。
* 这样，我们确保每个进程处理的数据是独立的，避免了多个进程读取相同的数据。

### **4. 模型训练：**

* **模型初始化：** 每个进程都会初始化一个相同的模型并将其移动到相应的 GPU 上。模型的创建是相同的，但是每个进程都会在不同的 GPU 上执行。
* **DDP包装模型：** 模型需要被 `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) 容器包装，这样在训练过程中，DDP 会处理梯度同步。具体来说，当一个进程完成反向传播计算后，DDP 会进行梯度的 **all-reduce** 操作，平均所有进程的梯度，并将平均结果更新到每个进程的模型中。

### **5. 梯度同步与累积：**

* **梯度同步：** 默认情况下，PyTorch 在每次反向传播后会自动同步梯度。但在梯度累积（gradient accumulation）过程中，我们不希望每一步都同步梯度，因为那样会浪费计算资源。为此，使用 `no_sync` 上下文管理器来避免在每个梯度累积步骤后进行同步。
* **梯度累积：** 只有在最后一次累积步骤时才会同步梯度，这样可以加快训练速度。

### **6. 损失计算与同步：**

* 在多 GPU 环境下，损失（loss）是每个进程计算的，但我们需要计算所有进程的平均损失。通过使用 `all_reduce` 操作，可以将每个进程的损失值同步并平均，确保所有进程都能看到相同的损失值。

### **7. 代码调整与优化：**

* **优化器配置：** 由于我们使用了 DDP，优化器的配置方式稍有不同。我们需要在 `DDP` 模型的 `module` 属性下调用优化器配置函数，而不是直接在模型上调用。
* **性能提升：** 通过多 GPU 协同工作，训练速度大大提高，处理的 tokens 数量也显著增加。

### **总结：**

通过使用 PyTorch 的 DDP，我们能够让多个 GPU 协同工作，从而加速训练过程。在训练过程中，通过适当调整数据加载、梯度同步和损失计算等方面的代码，可以确保每个进程协同工作且不出现数据冲突，从而实现高效的分布式训练。


# datasets used in GPT-2, GPT-3, FineWeb (EDU)

take a look at what data sets were used by gpt2 and gpt3 so gbt2 used this web
Text data set that was never released um there's an attempt at reproducing it called open web text uh so basically
roughly speaking what they say here in the paper is that they scraped all outbound links from Reddit and then uh
with at least three Karma and that was kind of like their starting point and they collected all the web P all the web pages and all the text in them and so
this was 45 million links and this ended up being 40 GB of text so uh so that's
roughly what gpt2 says about its data set so it's basically outbound links from Reddit now when we go over to gpt3
there's a training data set section and that's where they start to talk about um common coll which is a lot more uh used
actually I think even gpt2 talked about common coll um but basically it's not a
very high quality data set all by itself because it is extremely noisy this is a completely random subset of the internet
and it's much worse than you think so people go into Great Lengths to filter common craw because there's good stuff
in it but most of it is just like ad spam random tables and numbers and stock tickers and uh it's just total mess
so that's why people like to train on these data mixtures that they curate and
uh are careful with so a large chunk of these data mixtures typically will be common C like for example 50% of the
tokens will be comic but then here in gpt3 they're also using web text to from before so that's Reddit outbound but
they're also adding for example books and they're adding Wikipedia there's many other things you can decide to add
now this data set for gpt3 was also never released so today some of the data sets that I'm familiar with that are
quite good and would be representative of something along these lines are number one the red pajama data set or
more specifically for example the slim pajama subset of the red pajama data set which is a cleaned and D duplicated
version of it and just to give you a sense again it's a bunch of common crawl um C4 which is also as far as I know
more common craw but processed differently and then we have GitHub books archive Wikipedia stack exchange
these are the kinds of data sets that would go into these data mixtures now specifically the one that I like that
came out recently is called Fine web data set uh so this is an attempt to basically collect really high quality
common coll data and filter it in this case to 15 trillion tokens and then in
addition to that more recently huggingface released this fine web edu subset which is 1.3 trillion of
educational and 5.4 trillion of high educational content so basically they're
trying to filter common C to very high quality educational subsets and uh this
is the one that we will use there's a long uh web page here on fine web and
they go into a ton of detail about how they process the data which is really fascinating reading by the way and I would definitely recommend if you're
interested into Data mixtures and so on and how data gets processed at these scales a look at this uh page and more
specifically we'll be working with the fine web edu I think and it's basically educational content from the
internet uh they show that training on educational content in in their metrics
um uh works really really well and we're going to use this sample 10 billion
tokens subsample of it because we're not going to be training on trillions of tokens uh we're just going to train on
uh 10 billion sample of the fine web edu because empirically in my previous few
experiments this actually suffices to really get close to gpt2 Performance and it's um simple enough to work with and
so let's work with the sample 10 uh BT so our goal will be to download it
process it and make sure that our data loader can work with it so let's get to that okay so I introduced another um
file here that will basically download Fine web edu from huging face data sets
it will pre-process and pre- tokenize all of the data and it will save data shards to a uh folder on um local disk
and so while this is running uh just wanted to briefly mention that you can
kind of look through the data set viewer here just to get a sense of what's in here and it's kind of interesting I mean it's a it basically looks like it's
working fairly well like it's talking about nuclear energy in France it's talking
about Mexican America some mac PJs Etc so actually it
seems like their filters are working pretty well uh the filters here by the way were applied automatically using um
llama 370b I believe and so uh basically llms are judging which content is
educational and that ends up making it through the filter uh so that's pretty cool now in terms of the script itself
I'm not going to go through the full script because it's not as interesting and not as llm Centric but when you run
this basically number one we're going to load the data set uh which this is all huging face code running this you're
going to need to uh pip install data sets um so it's downloading the data set
then it is tokenizing all of the documents inside this data set now when we tokenize the documents you'll notice
that um to tokenize a single document uh we first
start the tokens with the end of text token and this is a special token in the gpt2 tokenizer as you know so
50256 is the ID of the end of text and this is what begins a document even
though it's called end of text but this is uh the first token that begins a document then we extend with all of the
tokens of that document then we create a numpy array out of that we make sure
that all the tokens are between oh okay let me debug this
okay so apologies for that uh it just had to do with me using a float division in Python it must be integer division so
that this is an INT and everything is nice um okay but basically the
tokenization here is relatively straightforward returns tokens in mp. un6 uh we're using .16 to save a little
bit of space because 2 to the 16us 1 is 65,000 so the gpt2 max token ID is well
below that and then here there's a bunch of multiprocessing code and it's honestly not that exciting so I'm not
going to step through it but we're loading the data set we're tokenizing it and we're saving everything to shards
and the shards are numpy files uh so just storing a numpy array and uh which
is very very similar to torch tensors and the first Shard 0000 is a
Val a validation Shard and all the other shards are uh training shards and as I
mentioned they all have 100 million tokens in them exactly um and and that
just makes it easier to work with as to Shard the files because if we just have a single massive file sometimes they can
be hard to work with on the disk and so sharting it is just kind of um nicer from that
perspective and uh yeah so we'll just let this run this will be probably um
30ish minutes or so and then we're going to come back to actually train on this data and we're going to be actually doing some legit pre-training in this
case this is a good data set we're doing lots of tokens per second we have 8 gpus
the code is ready and so we're actually going to be doing a serious training run so let's get P it back in a bit okay so
we're back so uh if we LS edu fine web we see that there's now 100 charts in it
um and that makes sense because each chart is 100 million tokens so 100 charts of that is 10 billion tokens in
total now swinging over to the main file I made some adjustments to our data loader again and that's because we're
not running with uh Shakespeare anymore we want to use the fine web shards and
so you'll see some code here that additionally basically can load these shards uh we load the um un6 numpy file
we convert it to a torch. long tensor which is what a lot of the layers up top expect by default and then here we're
just enumerating all the shards I also added a split to data load of light so
we can uh load the split train but also the split Val uh the zero split and then we can load the shards
and then here we also have not just the current position now but also the current Shard so we have a position
inside A Shard and then when we uh run out of tokens in A Single Shard we first
Advance The Shard and loop if we need to and then we get the tokens and readjust the position so this data loader will
now iterate all the shards as well so I Chang that and then the other thing that
I did while uh the data was processing is our train loader now has split train
of course and down here I set up some I set up some numbers so we are doing 2 to the
9 uh tokens per uh per um per step and
we want to do roughly 10 billion tokens um because that's how many unique tokens
we have so if we did 10 billion tokens then divide that by 29 we see that this
is 1973 steps so that's where that's from and then the GPT three paper says
that they warm up the learning rate over 375 million tokens so I came here and
375 E6 tokens divide uh 2 to the 19 is 715 steps so that's why warm-up
steps is set to 715 so this will exactly match um the warm-up schedule that gpt3
used and I think 715 by the way is very uh mild and this could be made significantly more aggressive probably
even like 100 is good enough um but it's okay let's leave it for now so that we have the exact hyper parameters
of gpt3 so I fix that and then um that's
pretty much it we can we can run so we have our script here and we can
launch and actually sorry let me do one more
thing excuse me for my GPU I can actually fit more
batch size and I believe I can fat I can fit 60 4 on my GPU as a micro bash size
so let me try that I could be misremembering but that
means 64 * 124 per GPU and then we have a gpus so that means we would not even
be doing gradient accumulation if this fits because uh this just multi multiplies out to uh the full total bat
size so no gradient accumulation and that would run pretty quickly if that fits
let's go let's go I mean if this works then this is basically a serious pre-training run um we're not logging
we're not evaluating the validation split we're not running any evaluations yet so it's not we haven't crossed our
te's and dotted our eyes but uh if we let this run for a while we're going to actually get a pretty good model and the
model that might even be on par with or better than gpt2 124 M okay so it looks
like everything is going great we're processing 1.5 million tokens per second uh everything here looks good
we're doing 330 milliseconds per iteration and we have to do a total
of uh where are we printing that 1973 so 19073 times 0.33
is this many seconds this many minutes so this will run for 1.7
hours uh so one and a half hour run uh like this and uh we don't even have to
use gradient accumulation which is nice and you might not have that luxury in your GPU in that case just start decreasing the batch size until things
fit but keep it to nice numbers um so that's pretty exciting
we're currently warming up the learning rate so you see that it's still very low one4 so this will ramp up over the next
few steps all the way to 6 e Nega uh 4
here very cool so now what I'd like to do is uh let's cross the T and do our eyes let's evaluate on the validation
split and let's try to figure out how we can run evals how we can do logging how we can visualize our losses and all the
good stuff so let's get to that before we actually do the run okay so I've adjusted the code so that we're

   * 使用 Hugging Face 的 `datasets` 库来下载和处理 Fine Web EDU 数据集。
   * 在下载过程中，数据集会被分成多个“shard”（数据片段），每个片段包含 1 亿个 token。这样做是为了避免处理大文件时出现性能瓶颈。
   * 数据经过 token 化处理，其中每个文档的开头都会加上特殊的 "end of text" token（50256）。

2. **数据加载器：**

   * 使用多线程和数据分片的方式进行数据加载，确保每个进程可以独立地加载和处理不同的 shard。
   * 训练时，每个进程会读取不同的 shard，这样就能有效地利用所有的 GPU 进行训练。

3. **训练和优化：**

   * 训练过程使用了 GPT-3 中的超参数设置，尤其是在学习率预热阶段，设定了 715 步的 warm-up 步骤，这个值来源于 GPT-3 论文中的设定。
   * 在 8 GPU 环境下，训练可以非常快速地处理每秒 150 万个 token，而整个训练过程可能需要约 1.7 小时完成。

### **训练过程和优化：**

1. **微批次与梯度累积：**

   * 使用微批次（micro-batch）进行训练，并且采用了合适的批次大小（如每个 GPU 上的批次大小为 64），避免了梯度累积的需求。
   * 如果 GPU 内存不足，可以减少批次大小来适配，但要确保批次大小为合理的数字，以避免内存溢出。

2. **学习率预热：**

   * 学习率在训练初期会有一个预热阶段，初期的学习率较小，然后逐渐增加，直到设定的最大值。这有助于避免在训练初期模型不稳定。

3. **训练日志与评估：**

   * 在训练过程中，首先进行学习率预热，然后开始正式的训练。在一定的训练步骤后，代码会启动对验证集的评估，并记录日志以便分析损失和其他指标。

### **总结：**

通过 Fine Web EDU 数据集，我们可以有效地训练一个高质量的语言模型。数据预处理、分片存储和多进程加载是训练大规模模型时的关键步骤。使用 Hugging Face 的 `datasets` 库来管理这些数据集，使得训练过程更加高效。此外，通过调整批次大小和学习率预热等超参数，我们可以优化训练过程，提高训练速度和模型性能。


# validation data split, validation loss, sampling revive

evaluating on the validation split so creating the Val loader just by passing in Split equals Val that will basically
create a data loader just for the uh validation Shard um the other thing I did is in the
data loader I introduced a new function reset which is called at init and it basically resets the data loader and
that is very useful because when we come to the main training Loop now so this is
the code that I've added and basically every 100th iteration including the zeroth iteration we put the model into
evaluation mode we reset the Val loader and then um no gradients involved we're
going to basically accumulate the gradients over say 20 steps and then average it all up
and print out the validation loss and so that basically is the exact same logic
as the training Loop roughly but there's no loss that backward it's only inference we're just measuring the loss
we're adding it up everything else otherwise applies and is exactly as we've seen it before and so this will
print the validation laws um every 100th iteration including on the very first
iteration uh so that's nice that will tell us some amount some a little bit about how much we're overfitting that
said like uh we have roughly Infinity data so we're mostly expecting our train and Val loss to be about the same but
the other reason I'm kind of interested in this is because we can take the GPT 2124m as openi released it we can
initialize from it and we can basically see what kind of loss it achieves on the validation loss as well and that gives
us kind of an indication as to uh how much that model would generalize to 124 M but it's not an sorry to fine web edu
validation split that said it's not a super fair comparison to gpt2 because it was trained on a very different data
distribution but it's still kind of like an interesting data point and in any case you would always want to have a
validation split in a training run like this so that you can make sure that you are not um overfitting and this is
especially a concern if we were to make more Epoch in our training data um so
for example right now we're just doing a single Epoch but if we get to a point where we want to train on 10 epochs or something like that we would be really
careful with maybe we are memorizing that data too much if we have a big enough model and our validation split
would be one way to tell whether that is happening okay and in addition to that if you remember at bottom of our script
we had all of this orphaned code for sampling from way back when so I deleted that code and I moved it up um to here
so once in a while we simply value validation once in a while we sample we generate
samples and then uh we do that only every 100 steps and we train on every
single step so that's how I have a structure right now and I've been running this for 10,000 iterations so
here are some samples on neration 1,000 um hello I'm a language model and I'm
not able to get more creative I'm a language model and languages file you're learning about
here is or is the beginning of a computer okay so this is all like pretty uh this
is still a garble uh but we're only at ration 1,000 and we've only just barely reached maximum learning rate uh so this
is still learning uh we're about to get some more samples coming up in
1,00 okay um okay this is you know the model is
still is still a young baby okay so uh basically all of this sampling code that
I've put here everything should be familiar with to you and came from before the only thing that I did is I created a generator object in pytorch so
that I have a direct control over the sampling of the random numbers don't because I don't want to impact the RNG
state of the random number generator that is the global one used for training I want this to be completely outside of
the training Loop and so I'm using a special sampling RNG and then I make
sure to seed it that every single rank has a different seed and then I pass in
here where we sort of consumer in the numbers in multinomial where the sampling happens I make sure to pass in
the generator object there otherwise this is identical uh now the other thing is um you'll notice that we're running a
bit slower that's because I actually had to disable torch. compile to get this to sample and um so we're running a bit
slower so for some reason it works with no torch compile but when I torch compile my model I get a really scary
error from pytorch and I have no idea how to resolve it right now so probably by the time you see this code released
or something like that maybe it's fixed but for now I'm just going to do end false um and I'm going to bring back
toor compile and you're not going to get samples and I I think I'll fix this
later uh by the way um I will be releasing all this code and actually I've been very careful about making get
commits every time we add something and so I'm going to release the entire repo that starts completely from scratch all
the way to uh now and after this as well and so everything should be exactly documented in the git commit history um
um and so I think that will be nice so hopefully by the time you go to GitHub uh this is removed and it's working and
I will have fixed the bug okay so I have the optimization running here and it's stepping and we're on step 6,000 or so

在这段内容中，主要讲解了如何在训练过程中使用 **验证数据集** 进行 **验证损失** 评估、**采样** 生成结果，并如何通过这些评估来优化模型训练。

### **验证数据集（Validation Split）与验证损失（Validation Loss）：**

1. **验证数据集加载器（Validation Loader）**：

   * 在训练过程中，每100步（包括第一次迭代），会将模型切换到评估模式（`eval()`）。然后，我们会重置验证数据加载器（`Val loader`），并确保在此期间不计算梯度（即只有推理而没有反向传播）。
   * 我们会累积每个验证步骤的损失，并计算出 **验证损失**，每100步打印一次，这有助于了解模型在验证集上的表现，并监控是否存在过拟合的风险。
   * 通过这种方式，模型会在验证集上进行检查，确保其在未见过的数据上仍有较好的表现。

2. **验证损失的作用**：

   * 验证损失有助于判断模型的泛化能力。尤其是当训练数据量巨大时，我们会担心模型是否只是在记住训练数据（过拟合），而不是学会从数据中抽象出一般化的知识。
   * 如果训练集和验证集的损失差异过大，就可能出现过拟合问题，因此定期检查验证损失非常重要。

3. **与 GPT-2 的对比**：

   * 你可以将当前模型与 GPT-2（124M）进行对比，查看验证损失，并作为一种参考，看看当前模型如何与已有的模型相比较。虽然训练集和验证集不同，直接对比不完全公平，但仍然是一个有价值的参考点。

4. **训练过程中的注意事项**：

   * 在当前的训练中，只进行了 **一个 Epoch** 的训练。如果未来希望进行多次 Epoch（例如 10 个 Epoch），则需要非常小心是否会出现 **过拟合**，特别是当模型非常大的时候。

### **采样与生成（Sampling and Generation）**：

1. **采样代码**：

   * 在每100步训练后，会生成一些文本样本，以便观察模型的生成效果。尽管在训练初期（例如第 1000 步），生成的文本仍然很杂乱、难以理解，但这是因为模型还处于早期阶段，学习率刚刚开始增加。
   * 生成的文本示例包括像“Hello, I’m a language model...”这样的话，但因为模型还没有完全训练好，这些输出仍然是混乱的。

2. **随机数生成器（RNG）**：

   * 为了确保训练过程中不影响随机数生成器的状态，采样时使用了一个独立的 **PyTorch 随机数生成器（RNG）**。这可以确保训练过程中的随机数生成与采样过程分开，避免互相干扰。
   * 每个进程都使用不同的种子（seed）来保证生成结果的多样性。

3. **Torch Compile 问题**：

   * 在使用 **`torch.compile`** 进行编译时，出现了某些错误，导致采样代码无法正常工作。为了解决这个问题，目前禁用了 `torch.compile`，以确保采样代码可以正常运行。不过，这个问题预计会在未来的版本中得到修复。

### **总结**：

* 训练过程中，使用验证数据集对模型进行定期评估，以防过拟合，并通过观察验证损失来判断模型的泛化能力。
* 在训练过程中定期生成样本有助于观察模型的生成能力，尽管初期生成的文本可能不太有意义，但它们可以帮助我们了解模型的学习进度。
* 使用独立的随机数生成器来进行采样，以避免与训练中的全局 RNG 状态冲突。
* 遇到 `torch.compile` 的问题时，暂时禁用该功能，确保采样能够正常运行。

总之，验证损失和生成样本是评估模型训练过程中非常重要的步骤，能够帮助我们确保模型在未见过的数据上表现良好，避免过拟合。


# evaluation: HellaSwag, starting the run

so we're about 30% through training now while this is training I would like to introduce one evaluation that we're
going to use to supplement the validation set and that is the H swag eval so hos swag comes from this paper
back in 2019 so it's a 5-year-old eval now and the way H swag works is there is basically a sentence completion data set
so it's a multiple choice for every one of these questions we have uh basically a shared context like a woman is outside
with a bucket and a dog the dog is running around trying to avoid bath she
a Rises the bucket off with soap and blow dry the dog's head B uses a hose to
keep it from getting soapy C gets the dog wet and it runs away again or D gets
into a bathtub with the dog and so basically the idea is that these
multiple choice are constructed so that one of them is a natural continuation of
the um sentence and the others are not and uh the others might not make
sense like uses the host to keep it from getting soaped that makes no sense and so what happens is that models that are
not trained very well are not able to tell these apart but models that have a lot of World Knowledge and can tell uh
which um and can tell a lot about the world will be able to create these completions and these sentences are
sourced from activity net and from Wiki how and at the bottom of the uh
paper there's kind of like a cool chart of the kinds of domains in Wiki house so
there's a lot of sentences from computers and electronics and Homes and Garden and it has kind of a broad
coverage of the kinds of things you need to know about the world in order to find the most likely completion and um the
identity of that of that completion one more thing that's kind of interesting about H swag is the way it was
constructed is that the incorrect um options are deliberately um
adversarially sourced so they're not just random sentences they're actually sentences generated by language models
and they're generated in such a way that language models basically find them difficult but humans find them easy and
so they mentioned that humans have a 95% accuracy on this set but at the time the state-of-the-art language models had
only 48% and so at the time this was a good Benchmark now you can read the
details of this paper to to learn more um the thing to point out though is that this is 5 years ago and since then what
happened to H swag is that it's been totally just uh um solved and so now the language models
here are 96% so basically the 4% the last 4% is probably errors in the data
set or the questions are really really hard and so basically this data set is kind of crushed with respect to language
models but back then the best language model was only at about 50% uh but this
is how far things got but still the the reason people like H swag and it's not
used by the way in gpt2 but in gpt3 there is H swag eval and lots of people
use H swag and so for gpt3 we have results
here that are cited so we know what percent accuracies gpt3 um attains at all these
different model checkpoints for H swag eval and the reason people like it is because H swag is a smooth eval and it
is an eval that offers quote unquote early signal uh so early signal means that even small language models are
going to start at the random chance of 25% but they're going to slowly improve and you're going to see 25 26 27 Etc and
uh you can see slow Improvement even when the models are very small and it's very early so it's smooth it has early
signal and um it's been around for a long time so that's why people kind of
like this eval uh now the way that we're going to evaluate this is as
follows as I mentioned we have a shared context and this is kind of like a multiple choice task but instead of
giving the model a multiple choice question and asking it for A B C or D uh we can't do that because these models
when they are so small as we are seeing here the models can't actually do multiple choice they don't understand
the concept of associating a label to one of the options of multiple choice uh they don't understand that so we have to
give it to them in a native form and the native form is a token completion so
here's what we do we construct a batch of four rows and uh T tokens whatever
that t happens to be then the shared context that is basically the context for the for choices the tokens of that
are shared across all of the rows and then we have the four options so we kind of like lay them out and then only one
of the options is correct in this case label three option three and so um this
is the correct option and option one two and for are incorrect now these options might be of
different lengths so what we do is we sort of like take the longest length and that's the size of the batch B BYT and
then some of these uh here are going to be pded Dimensions so they're going to be unused and so we need the tokens we
need the correct label and we need a mask that tells us which tokens are active and the mask is then zero for
these uh padded areas so that's how we construct these batches and then in
order to get the language model to predict A B C or D the way this works is basically we're just going to look at
the tokens their probabilities and we're going to pick the option that gets the
lowest or the highest average probability for the token so for the
tokens because that is the most likely completion according to the language model so we're just going to look at the
um probabilities here and average them up across the options and pick the one
with the highest probability roughly speaking so this is how we're going to do H swag
um and this is I believe also how uh gpt3 did it um this is how gpt3 did it
as far as I know but you should note that some of the other evals where you might see H swag may not do it this way
they may do it in a multiple choice format where you sort of uh give the the context a single time and then the four
completions and so the model is able to see all the four options before it picks the best possible option and that's
actually an easier task for a model because you get to see the other options when you're picking your choice um but
unfortunately models at our size can't do that only models at a bigger size are able to do that and so our models are
actually slightly handicapped in this way that they are not going to see the other options they're only going to see
one option at a time and they just have to assign probabilities and the correct option has to win out in this metric all
right so let's now implement this very briefly and incorporate it into our script okay so what I've done here is
I've introduced a new file called hell swag. py that you can take a look into and I'm not going to to step through all
of it because uh this is not exactly like deep code deep code it's kind of
like a little bit tedious honestly because what's happening is I'm downloading hsac from GitHub and I'm
rendering all of its examples and there are a total of 10,000 examples I am rendering them into this format um and
so here at the end of this render example function you can see that I'm
returning the tokens uh the tokens of this um 4xt
uh array of Tokens The Mask which tells us which parts are the options and
everything else is zero and the label that is the correct label and so that
allows us to then iterate the examples and render them and I have an evaluate function here which can load a um gpt2
from huging face and it runs the eval here um and it basically just calculates
uh just as I described it predicts the option that has the lowest or the highest prob ility and the way to do
that actually is we can basically evaluate the cross entropy loss so we're basically evaluating the loss of
predicting the next token in a sequence and then we're looking at the row that has the lowest average loss and that's
the uh option that we pick as the prediction and then we do some stats and
prints and stuff like that so that is a way to evaluate L swag now if you go up here I'm showing that for GPT 2124m if
you run this script you're going to see that H swag gets
29.5% um so that's the performance we get here now remember that random Chan is 25% so we haven't gone too far and
gpt2 XL which is the biggest the gpt2 gets all the way up to 49% roughly so uh
these are pretty low values considering that today's state-ofthe-art is more like 95% uh so these are definitely
older models by now and then there's one more thing called Uther harness which is a very piece of infrastructure for
running evals for language models and they get slightly different numbers and I'm not 100% sure what the discrepancy
is for these um it could be that they actually do the multiple choice uh instead of just the completions and that
could be the um uh the discrepancy but I'm not 100% sure about that i' have to take a look but for now our script
reports 2955 and so that is the number that we'd like to beat if we are training a GPD 2124m from scratch and
ourselves um so now I'm going to go into actually
incorporating this eval into our main training script and um and basically
because we want to evaluate it in a periodic manner so that we can track H swag and how it evolves over time and
see when when and if we cross uh this 2955 um sort of region so let's now walk
through some of the changes to train gpt2 thatp the first thing I did here is I actually made use compile optional
kind of and I disabled it by default and the problem with that is the problem
with compile is that unfortunately it does make our code faster but it actually breaks the evaluation code and
the sampling code it gives me a very gnarly message and I don't know why so hopefully by the time you get to the
codebase when I put it up on GitHub uh we're going to fix that by then but for now I'm running without torch compile
which is why you see this be a bit slower so we're running without torch compile I also create cre a log
directory log where we can place our log.txt which will record the train loss
validation loss and the H swag accuracies so a very simple text file and we're going to uh open for writing
so that it sort of starts empty and then we're going to append to it I created a simple variable that um
helps tell us when we have a last step and then basically periodically inside this Loop every 250th iteration or at
the last step we're going to evaluate the validation loss and then every 250th
iteration um we are going to evaluate H swag but only if we are not using
compile because compile breaks it so I'm going to come back to this code for evaluating H swag in a second and then
every 250th iteration as well we're also going to sample from the model and so you should recognize this as our ancient
code from way back when we started the video and we're just sampling from the model
and then finally here um these are if we're not after we validate sample and
evaluate hell swag we actually do a training step here and so this is one step of uh training and you should be
pretty familiar with all of what this does and at the end here once we get our training laws we write it to the file so
the only thing that changed that I really added is this entire section for H swag eval and the way this works is
I'm trying to get all the gpus to collaborate on the H swag and so we're iterating all the examples and then each
process only picks the examples that assigned to it so we sort of take I and
moded by the world size and we have to make it equal to rank otherwise we continue and then we render an example
put it on the GPU we get the low jits then I create a helper function that helps us basically predict the option
with the lowest loss so this comes here the prediction and then if it's correct we sort of keep count and then if
multiple processes were collaborating on all this then we need to synchronize their stats and so the way one way to do
that is to package up our statistics here into tensors which we can then call
this. alberon and sum and then here we sort of um unwrap
them from tensors so that we just have ins and then here the master process will print and log the hellis swag
accuracy so that's kind of the that's kind of it
and that's what I'm running right here so you see this optimization here and uh we just had a generation and this is
Step 10,000 out of about 20,000 right so we are halfway done and these are the
kinds of samples that uh we are getting at this stage so let's take a look hello I'm a language model so I'd like to use
it to generate some kinds of output hello I'm a language model and I'm a developer for a lot of
companies Al language model uh let's see if I can find fun
one
um I don't know you can go through this yourself but certainly the predictions are getting less and less random uh it
seems like the model is a little bit more self-aware and using language uh that is a bit
more uh specific to it being language model hello I'm a language model and
like how the language is used to communicate I'm a language model and I'm going to be speaking English and German
okay I don't know so let's just wait until this optimization finishes and uh we'll see what kind of samples we get
and we're also going to look at the train Val and the hway accuracy and see
how we're doing with respect to gpt2 okay good morning so focusing For a

这段内容介绍了如何在模型训练中加入 **HellaSwag** 评估（简称 **H-Swag**），以及如何将其与训练过程结合，进行周期性评估，监控模型的性能。

### **HellaSwag 评估简介**

1. **HellaSwag** 是一种 **句子完成** 任务的评估数据集，任务格式是给定一个上下文（比如：**“一个女人站在外面，手里拿着一个桶和狗，狗正在四处跑，试图避开洗澡”**），然后给出 4 个选项，要求模型选择一个最符合上下文的答案。例如：

   * A. 用肥皂把桶装满
   * B. 用水管把狗弄湿
   * C. 把狗弄湿后它再次跑开
   * D. 跟狗一起进浴缸

2. **数据集构造**：

   * 每个问题的 4 个选项中，只有一个是合理的回答，其他三个选项是无意义或者不符合上下文的答案。
   * 这些问题来自 **ActivityNet** 和 **WikiHow**，涵盖了许多领域，如计算机、电子产品、家庭园艺等，需要模型具备一定的世界知识来选择正确答案。
   * 其中，错误选项不是随机生成的，而是通过 **语言模型** 特意生成的，这样它们对于语言模型来说会很难处理，但对人类来说则很容易判断。

3. **评估过程**：

   * 语言模型需要根据上下文生成最有可能的句子完成，选择最合适的选项。H-Swag的一个重要特性是 **平滑的评估曲线**（smooth eval），即使是小型模型也能逐步提高准确度，能够早期给出模型学习的信号。
   * 然而，由于 H-Swag 是在 5 年前设计的，它的任务对现代的大型语言模型来说已经“过于简单”，很多模型的准确率已经达到 96%，但它仍然被用作 **早期信号** 评估，帮助观察小模型的训练进展。

### **如何在训练过程中实现 H-Swag 评估**

1. **模型与数据的准备**：

   * 为了使模型能够处理 H-Swag 任务，通常我们将每个问题和 4 个选项的上下文转换为 **token 完成** 形式。这意味着我们会将每个选项的内容作为模型输入的一部分，模型会根据输入的上下文来预测最合理的选项。
   * 由于我们训练的模型较小，因此无法直接使用常见的多项选择方式（即直接给出 4 个选项让模型一次性选择）。取而代之的是，每次给模型呈现一个选项，通过 **token 的概率分布** 来决定哪个选项是最可能的。

2. **评估实现**：

   * **评估代码**：编写一个 `hellaswag.py` 文件，该文件负责加载 H-Swag 数据，渲染问题并将其转化为模型可以处理的格式（例如 token 化）。每个问题的正确答案会被标记，并且会有一个 **mask** 用来标记哪些部分是有效的。
   * 然后，使用 **GPT-2 模型**（从 Hugging Face 加载）进行评估，计算模型对每个选项的预测损失（cross-entropy loss）。根据这个损失值，选择预测损失最小的选项作为答案。

3. **周期性评估**：

   * 在训练过程中，每 **250 步** 会进行一次评估，包括：

     * **验证损失**：用来检查模型是否在训练数据上表现良好。
     * **H-Swag 评估**：用来检查模型在任务上的表现。
     * **采样**：每 250 步采样一次模型输出，观察生成文本的质量。
   * 所有评估结果（训练损失、验证损失、H-Swag 准确率）都会写入日志文件，便于跟踪训练进度。

4. **多 GPU 协作**：

   * 由于训练是分布式的，需要确保多个 GPU 协同工作来进行 H-Swag 评估。每个进程会处理不同的样本，并在计算完成后进行统计汇总。最终，主进程会输出并记录评估结果。

### **训练过程中的性能**

* 在 **GPT-2 124M** 模型上进行 H-Swag 评估时，准确率大约为 29.5%。对于 GPT-2 XL 模型，准确率提升到约 49%。尽管这些值相对较低，但与随机猜测（25%）相比，已经有了明显的进步。
* 然而，现在的 **主流模型** 的 H-Swag 准确率已经接近 96%，这意味着 H-Swag 对于当前的模型来说已经不再是一个难题，而更多的是一个 “基准” 用来评估模型的进展。

### **总结**

通过周期性地进行 H-Swag 评估，能够帮助我们跟踪模型在句子完成任务中的表现。虽然这个任务对于现代的大型语言模型来说已经变得容易，但它仍然提供了一个有效的评估指标，尤其是在训练初期能够给出 **早期信号**，帮助我们判断模型的学习进展。同时，通过调整训练脚本，我们可以更方便地跟踪训练损失、验证损失和 H-Swag 准确率，从而优化模型训练。


# SECTION 4: results in the morning! GPT-2, GPT-3 repro

Moment On The jupyter Notebook here on the right I created a new cell that basically allows us to visualize the the
train Val and Hela and um the hel score and you can step through this it
basically like parses the log file that we are writing and um a lot of this is just like boring ma plot lip code but
basically this is what our optimization looks like so we ran for
19,731 billion tokens which is whoops oh my gosh which is one Epoch of the sample
10B of webd on the left we have the loss and the in blue we have the training
loss in Orange we have the validation loss and red as a horizontal line we
have the opening IG gpt2 124 M model checkpoint when it's just evaluated on
the validation set of um of this fine web edu uh so you can see that we are
surpassing this orange is below the red so we're surpassing the validation set of this data set and like I mentioned
the data set distribution is very different from what gpt2 trained on so this is not an exactly fair comparison
but it's a good cross check uh to uh to look at now we would ideally like
something that is withheld and comparable and somewhat standard um and
so for us that is helis swag and so on here we see the H swag progress we made from 25% all the way here in red we see
the open gpt2 124 M model in red so it
achieves this h bag here and the the gpt3 model 124 M which was trained on
300 billion tokens achieves green so that's over here so you see that we
basically surpassed the gbt2 24m uh model right here uh which is uh really
nice now interestingly we were able to do so with only training on 10 billion tokens while gpt2 was trained on 100
billion tokens so uh for some reason we were able to get away with significantly fewer tokens for training there are many
possibilities to as to why we could match or surpass this accuracy um with
only 10 million training so number one um it could be that opening gbt2 was
trained on a much wider data distribution so in particular fine web edu is all English it's not multilingual
and there's not that much math and code um and so math and code and multilingual
could have been stealing capacity from the original gpt2 model and um basically
that could be partially the reason why uh this is not working out there's many other reasons um so for example the H
swag eval is fairly old uh maybe 5 years or so it is possible that aspects of H
swag in some way or even identically have made it into the training Set uh of fine web we don't know for sure but if
that was the case then we are basically looking at the training curve instead of the validation curve so long story short this is not a perfect eval and there's
some caveats here uh but at least we have some confidence that that we're not doing something completely wrong and
um and uh it's probably the case that when people try to create these data sets they try to make sure that test
sets that are very common are not part of the training set for example uh when hugging face created the fine web BDU
they use H swag as an eval so I would hope that they make sure that they D duplicate and that there's no hella swag
in the training set but we can't be sure uh the other thing I wanted to address briefly is look at this loss curve this
looks really this looks really wrong here I don't actually know 100% what this is and I suspect it's because the
uh 10 billion sample of fine web edu was not properly shuffled um and there's
some issue here uh with the data that I don't fully understand yet and there's some weird periodicity to it um and
because we are in a very lazy way sort of serializing all the tokens and just iterating all them from scratch without
doing any permutation or any random sampling ourselves I think we're inheriting some of the ordering that
they have in the data set so uh this is not ideal but hopefully by the time you
get to this repo uh some of these things by the way will hopefully be fixed and I
will release this build n GPT repo and right now it looks a little ugly and
preliminary uh so hopefully by the time you get here it's nicer but down here I'm going to show aada and I'm going to
talk about about some of the things that happened after the video and I expect that we will have fixed uh the small
issue uh but for now basically this shows that uh our training is not uh completely wrong and it shows that uh
we're able to surpass the accuracy with only 10x the token budget um and
possibly it could be also that the data set may have improved so uh the original
uh gpt2 data set was web text it's possible that not a lot of care and attention went into the data set this
was very early in llms whereas now there's a lot more scrutiny on good practices around uh D duplication
filtering uh quality filtering and so on and it's possible that the data that we're training on is just of higher quality per token and that could be
giving us a boost as well so a number of cave has to think about but for now uh we're pretty happy with this um and yeah
now the next thing I was interested in is as you see it's a morning now so there was an overnight and I wanted to
basically see how far I could push the result so uh to do an overnight run I
basically did instead of one Epoch which took roughly two hours I just did a times four so that that would take eight
hours while I was sleeping and so we did four Epoch or roughly 40 billion uh tokens of training and I was trying to
see how far we could get um and so this was the only change and I reran the script and when I point uh and read the
log file at uh at the 40b uh this is what the curve look like okay so to narrate this number one
we are seeing this issue here here with the periodicity through the different Epoch and something really weird with
the fine web edu data set and that is to be determined uh but otherwise we are
seeing that the H swag actually went up by a lot and we almost we almost made it
uh to the GPT 324m accuracy uh up here uh but not quite so uh it's too bad that
I didn't sleep slightly longer um and uh I think if this was an uh five Epoch run
we may have gotten here now one thing to point out is that if you're doing multi Epoch runs uh we're not actually being
very careful in our data loader and we're not um I this data loader goes
through the data in exactly the same format and exactly the same order and
this is kind of suboptimal and you would want to look into extensions where you actually permute the data uh randomly
you permute the documents around in Every Single Shard on every single new Epoch um and po even permute the
shards and that would go a long way into decreasing the pricity and it's also better for the optimization so that
you're not seeing things ident in the identical format and you're introducing some of the some uh Randomness in how
the documents follow each other because you have to remember that in every single row these documents follow each
other and then there's the end of text token and then the next document so the documents are currently glued together
in the exact same identical manner but we actually want to break break up the documents and shuffle them around
because the order of the documents shouldn't matter and they shouldn't um basically we want to break up that
dependence because it's a kind of a spous correlation and so our data lad is not currently doing that and that's one
Improvement uh you could think of making um the other thing to point out
is we're almost matching gpt3 accuracy with only 40 billion tokens gpt3 trained on 300 billion tokens so again we're
seeing about a 10x um Improvement here with respect to learning efficiency uh
the other thing I wanted to and I don't actually know exactly what to attribute this to other than some of the things
that I already mentioned previously for the previous run uh the other thing I wanted to briefly mention is uh the max
LR here I saw some people already play with this a little bit in a previous related repository um and it turns out
that you can actually almost like three xas so it's possible that the maximum learning rate can be a lot higher and
for some reason the gpt3 hyper parameters that we are inheriting are actually extremely conservative and you can actually get away with a Higher
Learning rate and it would train faster so a lot of these hyper parameters um are quite tunable and feel free to play
with them and they're probably not set precisely correctly and um it's possible
that you can get away with doing this basically and if you wanted to exactly be faithful to gpt3 you would also want
to make the following difference you'd want to come here and the sequence length of gpt3 is 2x it's 20 48 instead
of 1,24 so you would come here change this to 248 for T and then if you want
the exact same number of tokens uh half a million per iteration or per step you
want to then decrease this to 32 so they still multiply to half a mil so that
would give your model sequence length equal to that of gpt3 and in that case basically the
um the models would be roughly identical as far as I'm as far as I'm aware
because again gpt2 and gpt3 are very very similar models now we can also look at some of the samples here from the
model that was trained overnight so this is the optimization and you see that here
we stepped all the way to 76290 also or so and these are the hos
mag we achieved was 33.2 4 and these are some of the samples from the model and
you can see that if you read through this and pause the video briefly you can see that they are a lot more coherent uh
so um and they're actually addressing the fact that it's a language model almost
so uh hello I'm a language model and I try to be as accurate as
possible um I'm a language model not a programming language I know how to communicate uh I
use Python um I don't know if you pause this and
look at it and then compare it to the one to the model that was only trained for 10 billion uh you will see that
these are a lot more coherent and you can play with this uh yourself one more thing I added to The Code by the way is this chunk of code
here so basically right after we evaluate the validation loss if we are the master process in addition to
logging the validation loss every 5,000 steps we're also going to save the checkpoint which is really just the
state dictionary of the model and so checkpointing is nice just because uh you can save the model and later you can
uh use it in some way if you wanted to resume the optimiz ation then in addition to saving the model we have to
also save the optimizer State dict because remember that the optimizer has a few additional buffers because of adom
so it's got the m and V and uh you need to also resume the optimizer properly
you have to be careful with your RNG seeds uh random number generators and so on so if you wanted to exactly be able
to resume optimization you have to think through the state of the of the training process but if you just want to save the
model this is how you would do it and one one nice reason why you might want to do this is because you may want to
evaluate the model a lot more carefully so here we are only kind of like winging
the hell swag eval but you may want to use something um nicer like for example
the Luther uh Luther evaluation hardness evaluation hardness hardness um so this
is a way to also evaluate language models and um so it's possible that um
you may want to use basically different infrastructure to more thoroughly evaluate the models on different um
evaluations and compare it to the opening gbt2 model on many other um tasks like for example that involve math
code or different languages and so on so this is a nice functionality to have as well
um and then the other thing I wanted to mention is that everything we've built here this is only the pre-training step
so um the GPT here is a it dreams documents it just predicts the next to
you can't talk to it like you can talk to chat GPT uh chat GPT if you wanted to talk to the model we have to fine-tune
it into the chat format and it's not actually like that complicated if you're looking at supervised fine-tuning or sft
really what that means is we're just swapping out a data set into a data set that is a lot more conversational and there's a user assistant user assistant
kind of structure and we just fine-tune on it and then we um we basically fill in the user tokens and we sample the
assistant tokens it's not a lot more deeper than that uh but basically we swap out the data set and continue
training uh but for now we're going to stop at uh pre-training one more thing that I wanted to briefly show you is

这段内容是视频或教学笔记的第 4 部分，作者在训练完成后讲解了 **训练结果的可视化、对比 GPT-2 和 GPT-3 训练效果**，并讨论了一些影响训练效率和质量的因素。下面是逐段中文解释：

---

## 🧪 **1. 训练结果可视化：训练损失 / 验证损失 / HellaSwag 表现**

作者在 Jupyter Notebook 中创建了一个 cell，读取前面训练时记录的日志文件（log.txt），并使用 `matplotlib` 绘图，展示训练进度：

* **蓝线：训练损失（train loss）**
* **橙线：验证损失（val loss）**
* **红线：GPT-2 官方模型（124M）在验证集上的损失（作为参考线）**

### 🔍 观察结果：

* 橙线低于红线，说明我们自己训练的模型在这个验证集上**已经超过了 GPT-2 的表现**。
* 虽然不是完全公平的对比（数据集分布不同），但这仍是一个值得参考的指标。

---

## 📊 **2. HellaSwag 准确率提升情况**

图中也展示了 **HellaSwag 准确率** 的提升情况：

* 从最初的随机猜测（25%）提升到了 **大约 30%+**
* 红线是 GPT-2 的准确率（29.5%）
* 绿线是 GPT-3 在同一任务上取得的准确率（约 33.5%）
* 我们训练的模型在仅使用 **10B（十亿）token** 的情况下**就超越了 GPT-2**

---

## 📉 **3. 为什么只用了 GPT-2 的 1/10 数据就超过了它？**

作者分析了几点可能的原因：

1. **数据质量提升**：GPT-2 用的是 WebText，我们用的是 FineWeb Edu，这个数据集更干净、聚焦于英语和高质量文本。
2. **数据范围更集中**：GPT-2 是多语言+代码+混合文本，训练目标更杂。而我们只用英文通识数据，更容易训练出稳定的语言模型。
3. **可能的数据泄露？**

   * HellaSwag 是公开数据集，有可能某些样本在 FineWeb 中出现过（但 HuggingFace 应该做过去重处理）。
   * 所以 HellaSwag 准确率并非 100% 可靠的泛化评估，只能作为**参考指标**。

---

## ⚠️ **4. 奇怪的训练损失周期性波动？**

图中训练损失曲线存在明显的波动（周期性震荡）：

* 原因可能是 **数据集未打乱**（没洗牌 shuffle）：

  * 我们的 data loader 是顺序加载所有 token，没有对文档或 shard 做打乱。
  * 导致每轮看到的文档顺序几乎一致，这会导致模型“记住顺序”，而不是泛化。
  * **改进建议**：在每轮训练前打乱文档顺序，甚至打乱每个 shard 的顺序，以减少“顺序依赖”。

---

## 🌙 **5. 过夜训练结果（40B tokens）**

作者将训练扩展为 4 个 epoch（总计约 40B tokens），训练了一整夜：

* **HellaSwag 准确率达到 33.2%**
* 已非常接近 GPT-3 124M 模型的准确率（33.5%）
* 同时训练损失进一步降低，但周期性波动仍然存在，说明 shuffle 问题未解决

---

## 💡 **6. 关于学习率（Learning Rate）和超参设置**

* GPT-3 使用的学习率其实非常保守（可能低估了训练能力）
* 实验发现可以将最大学习率提高 3 倍，**训练速度更快，效果也更好**
* **提示**：超参数（如学习率、batch size、seq length）并不是固定的，可以大胆尝试调整

---

## 🧠 **7. 模型采样质量显著提升**

展示了一些模型生成的文本样本，相较于 10B tokens 的模型，**语言更连贯、语义更明确**，说明模型的理解和表达能力都在稳步上升。

---

## 💾 **8. 模型保存（checkpointing）**

新增功能：每训练 5000 步保存一次模型状态：

* 保存内容包括：

  * `model.state_dict()`：模型的权重
  * `optimizer.state_dict()`：优化器状态（如 Adam 的动量变量 `m` 和 `v`）
* 保存这些内容可以用于 **继续训练或后续评估**

---

## 📋 **9. HellaSwag 评估方式仍有改进空间**

目前的 HellaSwag 评估比较“简化”：

* 仅支持单个选项的 token 完成评分
* 没有使用更完善的评估框架，比如 [EleutherAI 的 evaluation harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)，这个可以支持多个标准任务
* 如果需要更准确对比 GPT-2、GPT-3 的泛化能力，建议后续使用更高级的评估框架

---

## 💬 **10. 想做成像 ChatGPT 一样？需要 SFT**

目前训练的模型是一个“预训练语言模型”（只学会续写文本），还不是“对话模型”：

* 如果想让它像 ChatGPT 一样能对话，需要进行 SFT（监督微调）：

  * 换一个对话数据集（user-assistant 格式）
  * 用相同的训练方式继续训练
  * 并生成 assistant 的回答
* 实质上就是换了数据集、继续训练

---

# shoutout to llm.c, equivalent but faster code in raw C/CUDA

that of course what we've built up today was building towards nanog GPT which is this repository from earlier uh but also
there's actually another nanog GPT implementation and it's hiding in a more recent project that I've been working on
called llm Doc and lm. C is a pure Cuda
implementation of gpt2 or gpt3 training and it just directly uses uh Cuda and is
written as Cuda now the nanog gbt here acts as reference code in pytorch to the
C implementation so we're trying to exactly match up the two but we're hoping that the C Cuda is faster and of
course currently that seems to be the case um because it is a direct optimized implementation so train gpt2 Pi in LL
M.C is basically the nanog GPT and when you scroll through this file you'll find
a lot of things that very much look like um things that we've built up in this
lecture and then when you look at train gpt2 docu uh this is the C Cuda
implementation so there's a lot of MPI nickel GPU Cuda
cc++ and you have to be familiar with that but uh um when this is built up we
can actually run the two side by side and they're going to produce the exact same results but lm. C actually runs
faster so let's see that so on the left I have pytorch a nanog GPT looking thing
on the right I have the llmc call and here I'm going to launch the two both of these are going to be
running on a single GPU and here I'm putting the lm. C on GPU 1 and this one will grab uh gpu0 by default and
then we can see here that lm. c compiled and then allocate space and
it's stepping so basically uh meanwhile P torch is still
compiling because torch compile is a bit slower here than the lm. C nbcc Cuda
compile and so this program has already started running and uh we're still waiting here for torch compile now of
course uh this is a very specific implementation to gpt2 and 3 a pytorch is a very general neural network
framework so they're not exactly comparable but if you're only interested in training gpt2 and 3 lm. C is very
fast it takes less space it's faster to start and it's faster per
step and so P started to Stepping here and as you can see we're running at about 223,000 tokens per second here and
about 185,000 tokens per second here um
so quite a bit slower but I don't have full confidence that I exactly squeezed
out all the juice from the pytorch implementation but the important thing here is notice that if I Aline up the
steps you will see that the losses and Norms that are printed between these two are
identical so on the left we have the pie torch and on the right this C implementation and they're the same
except this one runs faster uh so that's kind of I wanted to show you also briefly lm. C and this is a parallel
implementation and it's also something that you may want to uh play with or look at and um it's kind of interesting

这段内容讲的是作者除了用 PyTorch 写了 `nanoGPT` 教学版，还**自己用纯 C/CUDA 实现了一个更快的 GPT 训练器项目，叫做 `llm.c`**。下面是逐段的中文解释：

---

## 🛠️ `llm.c` 是什么？

* `llm.c` 是一个 **用 C 和 CUDA 编写的 GPT-2/GPT-3 模型训练实现**。
* 它和我们一直讲解的 `nanoGPT` 很像，**功能一样（等价），但速度更快**，因为没有使用 PyTorch，而是直接用底层 CUDA 写的。
* PyTorch 是通用神经网络框架，容易用，但效率没那么极致；而 `llm.c` 是手写底层的专用实现，更快但更复杂。

---

## 🧩 文件结构对比

在 `llm.c` 项目中：

* `train_gpt2.py`：PyTorch 版的参考实现，基本上就是 nanoGPT 的代码。
* `train_gpt2.cu`（或 `.cpp/.cu`）：是**CUDA 版本的训练主程序**，它使用了大量的 C/C++ 和 CUDA 代码，甚至包含了分布式计算相关的内容（如 MPI、NCCL 等）。

---

## 🧪 运行对比实验

作者演示了同时运行两个程序：

| 左边                      | 右边                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| `nanoGPT`（PyTorch 版）    | `llm.c`（CUDA 原生版）  |
| 使用 GPU 0                | 使用 GPU 1           |
| 使用 `torch.compile()` 编译 | 使用 `nvcc` CUDA 编译器 |
| 编译慢、运行慢                 | 编译快、运行快            |

### ⏱️ 性能对比：

| 指标           | PyTorch（左）         | llm.c（右）           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 每秒训练 token 数 | \~185,000 tokens/s | \~223,000 tokens/s |
| 编译耗时         | 慢                  | 快                  |
| 占用内存         | 高                  | 低                  |

---

## ✅ 结果一致性

* **虽然运行速度不一样，两边打印出的 loss 值和 norm（梯度范数）是完全一样的**。
* 说明这两个实现完全对齐：训练过程是一样的，只是一个用 Python+PyTorch 实现，一个用 C/CUDA 实现。

---

## 🚀 总结：为什么关注 `llm.c`？

* 如果你只关心训练 GPT-2 / GPT-3 类型的模型，并且想追求 **极限速度**，那么 `llm.c` 是更好的选择。
* 它有以下优点：

  * 启动快
  * 内存占用少
  * 每步训练速度快
* 但缺点是：

  * **需要懂 C/CUDA**
  * 不如 PyTorch 灵活，调试也更难

---

## 📌 总结一句话：

> `llm.c` 是一个用 C/CUDA 写的 “更快版本的 nanoGPT”，专为 GPT-2/3 训练优化，运行速度比 PyTorch 快，但需要更高的编程基础。

---

如果你有兴趣我可以帮你分析 `llm.c` 的代码结构和关键实现点（比如模型 forward/backward 是怎么手写的），或者告诉你如何上手运行它。需要的话随时告诉我！


# summary, phew, build-nanogpt github repo

okay so at this point I should probably start wrapping up the video because I think it's getting way longer than I anticipated uh but we did Cover a lot of
ground and we built everything from scratch so as a brief summary we were looking at the gpt2 and GPT 3
papers we were looking at how you set up these training runs uh and all the considerations involved we wrote
everything from scratch and then we saw that over the duration of either a 2-hour training run or an overnight run
we can actually match the 124 million parameter checkpoints of gbt2 and gpt3
uh to a very large extent um in principle the code that we wrote would be able to train even bigger
models if you have the patients or the Computing resources uh and so you could potentially think about training some of
the bigger checkpoints as well um there are a few remaining issues to address
what's happening with the loss here which I suspect has to do with the fine web edu data sampling uh why can't we
turn on Torch compile uh it currently breaks generation and H swag what's up with that in the data loader we should
probably be permuting our data when we reach boundaries so there's a few more issues like that and I expect to be
documenting some of those over time in the uh build n GPT repository here which
I'm going to be releasing with this video if you have any questions or like to talk about anything that we covered
please go to discussions tab uh so we can talk here uh or please go to issues or pull request pull requests um
depending on what you'd like to contribute or also have a look at the uh Zero to Hero Discord and uh I'm going to
be hanging out here on N GPT um otherwise for now I'm pretty happy
about where we got um and I hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you later
