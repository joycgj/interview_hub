We build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT), following the paper "Attention is All You Need" and OpenAI's GPT-2 / GPT-3. We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) . I recommend people watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework and basics of tensors and PyTorch nn, which we take for granted in this video.

Suggested exercises:
- EX1: The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in nanoGPT).
- EX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.)
- EX3: Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?
- EX4: Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT?

我们将构建一个**生成式预训练变换器（GPT）**，参考《Attention is All You Need》论文和 OpenAI 的 GPT-2 / GPT-3。我们还会讨论它和如今席卷全球的 ChatGPT 之间的联系。我们还会演示如何用 GitHub Copilot（它本身就是 GPT）来辅助我们编写 GPT 代码（很有“元”感 😄）。
我建议大家先去看之前的 "makemore" 系列视频，熟悉**自回归语言建模**框架、张量（tensor）的基本操作，以及 PyTorch 的 `nn` 模块，这些在本视频中是默认已掌握的。

💻 推荐练习题：
- **EX1**：掌握 N 维张量，挑战题：把 `Head` 和 `MultiHeadAttention` 合并成一个类，让多个头并行处理，把“head”作为额外 batch 维度处理（答案见 nanoGPT）
- **EX2**：用你喜欢的数据集训练 GPT！可以训练 GPT 来做加法，例如 a+b=c，建议让模型预测 c 的数字，按逆序预测（因为加法通常是从低位开始的），数据 loader 需要调整，不用生成 train.bin 和 val.bin，输入 a+b 这部分的 loss 可以用 `y=-1` 屏蔽（参考 CrossEntropyLoss 的 ignore\_index）。能学会加法吗？如果能，进一步挑战：做一个 GPT 计算器，支持 + - \* /。这是高阶挑战，可能需要 Chain of Thought 技术。
- **EX3**：找一个超大数据集，让 train 和 val loss 之间看不出差距，先用这个大数据集预训练 Transformer，然后用这个模型初始化，finetune 在 tiny shakespeare 数据集上，看看能不能通过预训练获得更低的 val loss。
- **EX4**：读 transformer 的论文，自己实现一个额外的改进，看能否提升 GPT 性能。

# nanogpt-lecture (https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture)

Code created in the Neural Networks: Zero To Hero video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT. Publishing here as a Github repo so people can easily hack it, walk through the git log history of it, etc.

NOTE: sadly I did not go too much into model initialization in the video lecture, but it is quite important for good performance. The current code will train and work fine, but its convergence is slower because it starts off in a not great spot in the weight space. Please see nanoGPT model.py for # init all weights comment, and especially how it calls the _init_weights function. Even more sadly, the code in this repo is a bit different in how it names and stores the various modules, so it's not possible to directly copy paste this code here. My current plan is to publish a supplementary video lecture and cover these parts, then I will also push the exact code changes to this repo. For now I'm keeping it as is so it is almost exactly what we actually covered in the video.

这是 **《神经网络：从零到高手》视频教程系列**中，关于 nanoGPT 的**第一节课**里创建的代码。
之所以发布成这个 GitHub 仓库，主要是方便大家可以修改代码、查看 git 历史记录、学习代码演变过程等等。

⚠️ **注意**：
在视频课里，我没有详细讲解模型初始化部分，但其实这是**非常重要**的，初始化会直接影响模型性能。
当前的代码是可以正常训练、正常工作的，但因为权重初始位置选得不是很好，**收敛速度会偏慢**。

如果你去看 nanoGPT 仓库里的 `model.py`，里面有 `# init all weights` 相关的注释，重点是看看 `_init_weights` 函数是怎么调用的。

不过有点可惜，这里视频课用的代码和 nanoGPT 正式仓库的代码在命名和模块存储方式上有些差异，**不能直接复制粘贴** nanoGPT 仓库里的代码到这个 repo 来用。

我计划之后录一个**补充视频**，专门讲解这部分内容，到时候也会把修改后的代码 push 到这个 repo。
目前我先保持这个 repo 和视频里的代码版本**完全一致**，便于大家对照视频学习。

# intro: ChatGPT, Transformers, nanoGPT, Shakespeare

hi everyone so by now you have probably heard of chat GPT it has taken the world and AI Community by storm and it is a
system that allows you to interact with an AI and give it text based tasks so
for example we can ask chat GPT to write us a small Hau about how important it is that people understand Ai and then they
can use it to improve the world and make it more prosperous so when we run this AI knowledge brings prosperity for all
to see Embrace its power okay not bad and so you could see that chpt went from left to right and
generated all these words SE sort of sequentially now I asked it already the
exact same prompt a little bit earlier and it generated a slightly different outcome ai's power to grow ignorance
holds us back learn Prosperity weights so uh pretty good in both cases and
slightly different so you can see that chat GPT is a probabilistic system and for any one prompt it can give us
multiple answers sort of uh replying to it now this is just one example of a
problem people have come up with many many examples and there are entire websites that index interactions with
chpt and so many of them are quite humorous explain HTML to me like I'm a dog uh write release notes for chess 2
write a note about Elon Musk buying a Twitter and so on so as an example uh
please write a breaking news article about a leaf falling from a tree uh and a shocking turn of events a
leaf has fallen from a tree in the local park Witnesses report that the leaf which was previously attached to a branch of a tree attached itself and
fell to the ground very dramatic so you can see that this is a pretty remarkable system and it is what we call a language
model uh because it um it models the sequence of words or characters or
tokens more generally and it knows how sort of words follow each other in English language and so from its
perspective what it is doing is it is completing the sequence so I give it the start of a sequence and it completes the
sequence with the outcome and so it's a language model in that sense now I would
like to focus on the under the hood of um under the hood components of what makes CH GPT work so what is the neural
network under the hood that models the sequence of these words and that comes
from this paper called attention is all you need in 2017 a landmark paper a
landmark paper in AI that produced and proposed the Transformer architecture so GPT is uh short for
generally generatively pre-trained Transformer so Transformer is the neuron nut that actually does all the heavy
lifting under the hood it comes from this paper in 2017 now if you read this paper this uh reads like a pretty random
machine translation paper and that's because I think the authors didn't fully anticipate the impact that the Transformer would have on the field and
this architecture that they produced in the context of machine translation in their case actually ended up taking over
uh the rest of AI in the next 5 years after and so this architecture with
minor changes was copy pasted into a huge amount of applications in AI in more recent years and that includes at
the core of chat GPT now we are not going to what I'd like to do now is I'd
like to build out something like chat GPT but uh we're not going to be able to of course reproduce chat GPT this is a
very serious production grade system it is trained on uh a good chunk of
internet and then there's a lot of uh pre-training and fine-tuning stages to it and so it's very complicated what I'd
like to focus on is just to train a Transformer based language model and in
our case it's going to be a character level language model I still think that is uh very educational with respect to
how these systems work so I don't want to train on the chunk of Internet we need a smaller data set in this case I
propose that we work with uh my favorite toy data set it's called tiny Shakespeare and um what it is is
basically it's a concatenation of all of the works of sh Shakespeare in my understanding and so this is all of
Shakespeare in a single file uh this file is about 1 megab and it's just all
of Shakespeare and what we are going to do now is we're going to basically model how these characters uh follow each
other so for example given a chunk of these characters like this uh given some
context of characters in the past the Transformer neural network will look at the characters that I've highlighted and
is going to predict that g is likely to come next in the sequence and it's going to do that because we're going to train
that Transformer on Shakespeare and it's just going to try to produce uh character sequences that look like this
and in that process is going to model all the patterns inside this data so once we've trained the system i' just
like to give you a preview we can generate infinite Shakespeare and of course it's a fake thing that looks kind
of like Shakespeare um apologies for there's some Jank that
I'm not able to resolve in in here but um you can see how this is going
character by character and it's kind of like predicting Shakespeare like language so verily my Lord the sites
have left the again the king coming with my curses with precious pale and then
tranos say something else Etc and this is just coming out of the Transformer in a very similar manner as it would come
out in chat GPT in our case character by character in chat GPT uh it's coming out
on the token by token level and tokens are these sort of like little subword pieces so they're not Word level they're
kind of like word chunk level um and now I've already written
this entire code uh to train these Transformers um and it is in a GitHub
repository that you can find and it's called nanog GPT so nanog GPT is a repository that
you can find in my GitHub and it's a repository for training Transformers um on any given text and what I think is
interesting about it because there's many ways to train Transformers but this is a very simple implementation so it's just two files of 300 lines of code each
one file defines the GPT model the Transformer and one file trains it on some given Text data set and here I'm
showing that if you train it on a open web Text data set which is a fairly large data set of web pages then I
reproduce the the performance of gpt2 so gpt2 is an early version of open
AI GPT uh from 2017 if I recall correctly and I've only so far
reproduced the the smallest 124 million parameter model uh but basically this is just proving that the codebase is
correctly arranged and I'm able to load the uh neural network weights that openi
has released later so you can take a look at the finished code here in N GPT
but what I would like to do in this lecture is I would like to basically uh write this repository from scratch so
we're going to begin with an empty file and we're we're going to define a Transformer piece by piece we're going
to train it on the tiny Shakespeare data set and we'll see how we can then uh generate infinite Shakespeare and of
course this can copy paste to any arbitrary Text data set uh that you like uh but my goal really here is to just
make you understand and appreciate uh how under the hood chat GPT works and um
really all that's required is a Proficiency in Python and uh some basic understanding of um calculus and
statistics and it would help if you also see my previous videos on the same YouTube channel in particular my make more
series where I um Define smaller and simpler neural network language models
uh so multi perceptrons and so on it really introduces the language modeling framework and then uh here in this video
we're going to focus on the Transformer neural network itself okay so I created a new Google collab uh jup notebook here

当然可以，我来帮你把这一段视频的内容用中文解释一下，方便你理解：

### 【视频开头介绍】ChatGPT、Transformer、nanoGPT、莎士比亚数据集

大家好！现在你们应该都听说过 ChatGPT 了吧？它在 AI 界和全世界都引起了轰动。ChatGPT 是一个可以用文字和 AI 互动的系统，可以帮你完成各种文字相关的任务。

比如我可以让它写一首关于“人们理解 AI 重要性、并用 AI 让世界更繁荣”的小俳句。它就会生成类似这样的一段文字：
👉 "AI knowledge brings prosperity for all to see. Embrace its power."

我之前也用相同的提示试过一次，结果不太一样，说明 ChatGPT 是一个**概率模型**，同样的提示语可能会生成不同的答案。

网络上已经有很多人总结出各种有趣的用法，比如让它用“狗能听懂的方式”解释 HTML，写“国际象棋 2 版本”的更新日志，或者模拟新闻稿：
👉 “震惊！一片树叶从树上掉了下来！” 😂

所以可以看到 ChatGPT 是一个非常厉害的“**语言模型**”，它的核心能力就是“预测下一个词”，它能理解一个词接下来的词是什么，把句子补完。

那么，**ChatGPT 背后的神经网络到底是什么？**
核心就是 2017 年的论文《**Attention is All You Need**》，这篇划时代的论文提出了 Transformer 这种神经网络架构。

**GPT** 全称是 "Generatively Pretrained Transformer"（生成式预训练 Transformer），Transformer 结构就是这个模型的核心计算单元。虽然最初论文是为了机器翻译写的，但后来这种结构被整个 AI 界大量借鉴，几乎所有大语言模型，包括 ChatGPT，核心都是 Transformer。

---

### 这一节课我们要做什么？

当然，我们不会去复刻 ChatGPT —— 那是一个非常复杂的商业系统，用了大规模互联网数据训练，还有很多预训练 + 微调 + RLHF（强化学习）过程。

**我们要做的**，是自己**训练一个基于 Transformer 的语言模型**，而且是一个简单的“**字符级**语言模型”（不是词级，不是子词级），这样可以更容易理解它的工作原理。

为了方便，我们不用整个互联网数据，选择一个小的数据集：**Tiny Shakespeare**，也就是莎士比亚全集拼成的一个 1MB 左右的纯文本文件。

我们要做的事情就是：
给 Transformer 一个前面的若干字符，让它预测下一个字符会是什么。这样，训练完之后我们可以“生成”出无穷的“莎士比亚风格”文字。

例子：
👉 "Verily, my lord, the sites have left thee again..."
这些都是模型按字符逐个生成出来的，和 ChatGPT 按 token（子词单元）生成的方式是一样的，只不过我们简单一些，直接用字符。

---

### nanoGPT 是什么？

其实我已经写好了完整的代码，可以在我的 GitHub 仓库里找到，叫做 **nanoGPT**。

这个 nanoGPT 仓库的特点是**实现非常简单**：

* 只用了两个文件，每个 300 行左右
* 一个文件是定义 Transformer（GPT）模型
* 另一个文件是训练代码

而且我已经验证过，nanoGPT 是可以跑出来和早期 GPT-2 相同水平的结果的（我复现了 GPT-2 小模型 124M 参数版本的效果）。

---

### 本节课的目标

我这次不是带你直接用 nanoGPT，而是**从零开始**，一步步在 Jupyter notebook 里写出这个小 GPT 语言模型：

1. 定义 Transformer 模型
2. 用 tiny Shakespeare 数据训练它
3. 训练完可以生成“假莎士比亚”风格文本
4. 你也可以把这个代码复制到任何别的文本数据集上用

核心目标是：**让你理解 ChatGPT 背后的 Transformer 是怎么工作的**。

只要你懂一点 Python，有基本的微积分和统计学基础，如果还看过我之前的 “makemore” 系列视频（里边介绍了语言建模、多层感知机 MLP 等基础神经网络），就完全能学会。

---

最后，我打开了一个新的 Google Colab 笔记本，准备开始编码。

---

如果你需要，我还可以帮你总结一下**这一节课的学习重点**，或者**整理一个适合入门 Transformer / GPT 的学习路线**，要不要我再补充？ 🌟


# reading and exploring the data

and this will allow me to later easily share this code that we're going to develop together uh with you so you can follow along so this will be in a video
description uh later now here I've just done some preliminaries I downloaded the
data set the tiny Shakespeare data set at this URL and you can see that it's about a 1 Megabyte file then here I open
the input.txt file and just read in all the text of the string and we see that we are working with 1 million characters
roughly and the first 1,000 characters if we just print them out are basically what you would expect this is the first
1,000 characters of the tiny Shakespeare data set roughly up to here so so far so
good next we're going to take this text and the text is a sequence of characters in Python so when I call the set
Constructor on it I'm just going to get the set of all the characters that occur
in this text and then I call list on that to create a list of those characters instead of just a set so that
I have an ordering an arbitrary ordering and then I sort that so basically we get
just all the characters that occur in the entire data set and they're sorted now the number of them is going to be
our vocabulary size these are the possible elements of our sequences and we see that when I print here the
characters there's 65 of them in total there's a space character and then all kinds of special characters and then U
capitals and lowercase letters so that's our vocabulary and that's the sort of like possible uh characters that the
model can see or emit okay so next we will would like to develop some strategy

当然可以，下面是这一段内容的中文解释：

### 【读取和探索数据】

作者说，之所以在 Colab 里写代码，是方便把代码分享出来，大家可以一起跟着学习，视频发布后会把代码链接放在视频描述里。

接下来，作者做了一些准备工作：

1. **下载数据集**
   下载了 **tiny Shakespeare** 数据集，网址会在视频描述里贴出。这个数据集文件大概 **1MB** 大小，名字叫 `input.txt`。

2. **读取数据**
   读入这个 `input.txt` 文件的全部内容，放到一个字符串里。
   这个字符串总共有大约 **100 万个字符**（characters）。

3. **打印前 1000 个字符**
   打印了数据开头的前 1000 个字符，内容就是莎士比亚的原文，非常正常。

---

### 【统计字符集】

接下来，作者用 Python 处理这段文本，思路是：

* 文本在 Python 里本质上就是一个**字符序列**（sequence of characters）。
* 用 Python 的 `set()` 函数，可以得到文本中**出现过的所有不同字符**（去重了）。
* 然后用 `list()` 把 set 转成列表，这样可以保证有一个确定的顺序。
* 再用 `sorted()` 排序，这样就得到了**有序的字符表**。

最终，得到的数据是：**整个数据集中一共出现了 65 个不同的字符**，这 65 个字符就是我们的“词表（vocabulary）”。

词表里包括：

* 空格（space）
* 标点符号
* 大写字母 A-Z
* 小写字母 a-z
* 其他一些特殊字符

---

### 【为什么要做这个？】

这些 65 个字符就是**模型可以看到的、也可以输出的“基础元素”**。

* 模型看到的是一串字符序列
* 模型的任务就是学会“给定前面的字符，预测下一个字符”
* 这 65 个字符就是模型能预测的“选项空间”

---

接下来，作者会继续讲如何把这些字符编码成模型能理解的数字，然后做成训练数据。

---

如果你需要的话，我还可以帮你画一个**整个数据处理流程图**，更方便你理解！要不要我整理一下？ 🌟


# tokenization, train/val split

to tokenize the input text now when people say tokenize they mean convert
the raw text as a string to some sequence of integers According to some uh notebook According to some vocabulary
of possible elements so as an example here we are going to be building a character level language model so we're
simply going to be translating individual characters into integers so let me show you uh a chunk of code that
sort of does that for us so we're building both the encoder and the decoder and let me just talk through what's
happening here when we encode an arbitrary text like hi there we're going to receive a
list of integers that represents that string so for example 46 47 Etc and then
we also have the reverse mapping so we can take this list and decode it to get
back the exact same string so it's really just like a translation to integers and back for arbitrary string
and for us it is done on a character level now the way this was achieved is we just
iterate over all the characters here and create a lookup table from the character to the integer and vice versa and then
to encode some string we simply translate all the characters individually and to decode it back we
use the reverse mapping and concatenate all of it now this is only one of many possible encodings or many possible sort
of tokenizers and it's a very simple one but there's many other schemas that people have come up with in practice so
for example Google uses a sentence piece uh so sentence piece will also encode text into um integers but in a
different schema and using a different vocabulary and sentence piece is a
subword uh sort of tokenizer and what that means is that um you're not encoding entire words but you're not
also encoding individual characters it's it's a subword unit level and that's
usually what's adopted in practice for example also openai has this Library called tick token that uses a bite pair
encode tokenizer um and that's what GPT uses and you can also just encode words into
like hell world into a list of integers so as an example I'm using the Tik token
Library here I'm getting the encoding for gpt2 or that was used for gpt2
instead of just having 65 possible characters or tokens they have 50,000
tokens and so when they encode the exact same string High there we only get a
list of three integers but those integers are not between 0 and 64 they are between Z and 5,
5,256 so basically you can trade off the code book size and the sequence lengths
so you can have very long sequences of integers with very small vocabularies or we can have short um sequences of
integers with very large vocabularies and so typically people use in practice
these subword encodings but I'd like to keep our token ier very simple so we're using character level tokenizer and that
means that we have very small code books we have very simple encode and decode functions uh but we do get very long
sequences as a result but that's the level at which we're going to stick with this lecture because it's the simplest
thing okay so now that we have an encoder and a decoder effectively a tokenizer we can tokenize the entire
training set of Shakespeare so here's a chunk of code that does that and I'm going to start to use the pytorch
library and specifically the torch. tensor from the pytorch library so we're going to take all of the text in tiny
Shakespeare encode it and then wrap it into a torch. tensor to get the data tensor so here's what the data tensor
looks like when I look at just the first 1,000 characters or the 1,000 elements of it so we see that we have a massive
sequence of integers and this sequence of integers here is basically an identical translation of the first
10,000 characters here so I believe for example that zero is a new line character and maybe one
one is a space not 100% sure but from now on the entire data set of text is re-represented as just it's just
stretched out as a single very large uh sequence of integers let me do one more thing before
we move on here I'd like to separate out our data set into a train and a validation split so in particular we're
going to take the first 90% of the data set and consider that to be the training data for the Transformer and we're going
to withhold the last 10% at the end of it to be the validation data and this will help us understand to what extent
our model is overfitting so we're going to basically hide and keep the validation data on the side because we
don't want just a perfect memorization of this exact Shakespeare we want a neural network that sort of creates
Shakespeare like uh text and so it should be fairly likely for it to produce the actual like stowed away uh
true Shakespeare text um and so we're going to use this to uh get a sense of
the overfitting okay so now we would like to start plugging these text sequences or integer sequences into the

当然可以，下面是这一段的中文解释：

### 【分词（tokenization）和训练/验证集划分】

首先，**“tokenization（分词）”** 的意思是：
把原始的**字符串**（text）转换成一串**整数序列**（sequence of integers）。
整数序列是根据某个“词表”来映射的，每个字符（或者词）对应一个整数。

---

### 【字符级语言模型的 tokenization】

在这个项目里，我们是做**字符级语言模型**，所以我们的“词表”就是前面统计出来的 65 个字符：
每个字符 → 一个整数（编号）

我们要做两个函数：

* `encode(text)` ：把一段字符串转成一串整数序列
* `decode(int_seq)` ：把一串整数序列转回原始字符串

比如：
字符串 `"Hi there"` → \[46, 47, ...] → 还能 decode 回 `"Hi there"`。

具体做法是：

* 遍历 65 个字符，做一个查表（lookup table），字符 → 整数；反向表，整数 → 字符。
* encode 的时候，就是查表编码；decode 的时候，是查表还原。

---

### 【其他常用 tokenizer 的对比】

其实 tokenizer 不止一种，现实中大模型通常不用字符级 tokenizer，而是用更复杂的：

* Google 常用 **sentencepiece**：一种子词级（subword） tokenizer
* OpenAI 用 **tiktoken** 库，里面用的是 BPE（Byte Pair Encoding） tokenizer，GPT 就是用的这个

子词级 tokenizer 的特点是：

* 编码粒度比字符大（不是一个字符一个 token）
* 也不是整个词作为 token，而是词的一部分（subword）
* 通常词表会有几万种 token，比如 GPT-2 用了 50,000 个 token

比如同样一句话："Hi there"：

* 用子词 tokenizer 编码后，可能只需要 3 个整数
* 用字符 tokenizer 编码，可能要 8 个整数（每个字符一个）

子词 tokenizer 的优点是序列更短，模型效率更高，实际工程里基本都是用这个。

不过为了简单起见，这个视频里我们用的是最简单的**字符 tokenizer**，
编码函数、解码函数都很简单，词表小，缺点是序列比较长。

---

### 【tokenize 全部数据】

有了 encoder 和 decoder 之后，我们就可以 tokenize 整个 tiny Shakespeare 数据集了。
做法是：

1. 把整个文本 encode 成一个整数序列
2. 用 pytorch 里的 `torch.tensor` 把这个整数序列包装成 tensor，供后面模型训练用

打印出来可以看到，这个 tensor 其实就是一个**巨大的整数序列**，和原文是一一对应的：
比如第 0 号整数对应换行符、第 1 号整数可能对应空格等等。

---

### 【划分训练集 / 验证集】

在正式训练前，还需要做一步：

* 把数据集分成 90% 训练集，10% 验证集。

为什么要分？

* **训练集**用来让模型学习。
* **验证集**是留出来不让模型看到的，用来测试模型的泛化能力（有没有过拟合）。

因为我们不希望模型只是**死记硬背** tiny Shakespeare，
而是希望它学会**生成“类似莎士比亚风格”的新文本**，
所以需要用验证集来衡量模型是不是学到泛化能力了。

---

### 【下一步】

接下来，作者会开始把这些整数序列喂到 Transformer 里，正式开始训练语言模型了 🚀。

如果你需要，我也可以顺便帮你总结一下：
👉 为什么“字符 tokenizer” vs “子词 tokenizer”
👉 为什么一定要 train/val split
👉 pytorch 里 tensor 为什么要用 long 类型（因为做 embedding）

# data loader: batches of chunks of data

Transformer so that it can train and learn those patterns now the important thing to realize is we're never going to
actually feed entire text into a Transformer all at once that would be computationally very expensive and
prohibitive so when we actually train a Transformer on a lot of these data sets we only work with chunks of the data set
and when we train the Transformer we basically sample random little chunks out of the training set and train on
just chunks at a time and these chunks have basically some kind of a length and
some maximum length now the maximum length typically at least in the code I usually write is called block size you
can you can uh find it under different names like context length or something like that let's start with the block
size of just eight and let me look at the first train data characters the first block size plus one characters
I'll explain why plus one in a second so this is the first nine characters in the sequence in the
training set now what I'd like to point out is that when you sample a chunk of data like this so say the these nine
characters out of the training set this actually has multiple examples packed into it and uh that's because all of
these characters follow each other and so what this thing is going to say when
we plug it into a Transformer is we're going to actually simultaneously train it to make prediction at every one of
these positions now in the in a chunk of nine characters there's actually eight indiv
ual examples packed in there so there's the example that when 18 when in the
context of 18 47 likely comes next in a context of 18 and 47 56 comes next in a
context of 18 47 56 57 can come next and so on so that's the eight individual
examples let me actually spell it out with code so here's a chunk of code to
illustrate X are the inputs to the Transformer it will just be the first block size characters y will be the uh
next block size characters so it's offset by one and that's because y are the targets for each position in the
input and then here I'm iterating over all the block size of eight and the context is always all the characters in
x uh up to T and including T and the target is always the teth character but
in the targets array y so let me just run this and basically it spells out what I
said in words uh these are the eight examples hidden in a chunk of nine characters that we uh sampled from the
training set I want to mention one more thing we train on all the eight examples
here with context between one all the way up to context of block size and we train on that not just for computational
reasons because we happen to have the sequence already or something like that it's not just done for efficiency it's
also done um to make the Transformer Network be used to seeing contexts all
the way from as little as one all the way to block size and we'd like the transform to be used to seeing
everything in between and that's going to be useful later during inference because while we're sampling we can
start the sampling generation with as little as one character of context and the Transformer knows how to predict the
next character with all the way up to just context of one and so then it can predict everything up to block size and
after block size we have to start truncating because the Transformer will will never um receive more than block
size inputs when it's predicting the next character Okay so we've looked at the time dimension of the tensors that are
going to be feeding into the Transformer there's one more Dimension to care about and that is the batch Dimension and so
as we're sampling these chunks of text we're going to be actually every time we're going to feed them into a
Transformer we're going to have many batches of multiple chunks of text that are all like stacked up in a single
tensor and that's just done for efficiency just so that we can keep the gpus busy uh because they are very good
at parallel processing of um of data and so we just want to process multiple
chunks all at the same time but those chunks are processed completely independently they don't talk to each other and so on so let me basically just
generalize this and introduce a batch Dimension here's a chunk of code let me just run it and then I'm
going to explain what it does so here because we're going to start sampling random locations in the
data set to pull chunks from I am setting the seed so that um in the
random number generator so that the numbers I see here are going to be the same numbers you see later if you try to reproduce this now the batch size here
is how many independent sequences we are processing every forward backward pass of the
Transformer the block size as I explained is the maximum context length to make those predictions so let's say B
size four block size eight and then here's how we get batch for any arbitrary split if the split is a
training split then we're going to look at train data otherwise at valid data that gives us the data array and then
when I Generate random positions to grab a chunk out of I actually grab I
actually generate batch size number of Random offsets so because this is four
we are ex is going to be a uh four numbers that are randomly generated between zero and Len of data minus block
size so it's just random offsets into the training set and then X's as I explained are the
first first block size characters starting at I the Y's are the offset by
one of that so just add plus one and then we're going to get those chunks for
every one of integers I INX and use a torch. stack to take all those uh uh
one-dimensional tensors as we saw here and we're going to um stack them up at
rows and so they all become a row in a 4x8 tensor
so here's where I'm printing then when I sample a batch XB and YB the inputs to
the Transformer now are the input X is the 4x8 tensor four uh rows of eight
columns and each one of these is a chunk of the training set and then the targets here are in the
associated array Y and they will come in to the Transformer all the way at the end uh to um create the loss function
uh so they will give us the correct answer for every single position inside X and then these are the four
independent rows so spelled out as we did before uh this 4x8 array contains a
total of 32 examples and they're completely independent as far as the Transformer is
concerned uh so when the input is 24 the target is 43 or rather 43 here in the Y
array when the input is 2443 the target is 58 uh when the input is 24 43 58 the
target is 5 Etc or like when it is a 52 581 the target is
58 right so you can sort of see this spelled out these are the 32 independent examples packed in to a single batch of
the input X and then the desired targets are in y and so now this integer tensor
of um X is going to feed into the Transformer and that Transformer is
going to simultaneously process all these examples and then look up the correct um integers to predict in every
one of these positions in the tensor y okay so now that we have our batch of input that we'd like to feed into a

当然可以，下面是这一段的中文解释：

### 【Data Loader：分块 + 批量加载数据】

接下来要准备把数据送进 Transformer 训练了，这里有几个重要的概念：

---

### 1️⃣ 不能把整个文本一次性送进去

* Transformer 一次处理太长序列会非常消耗内存（计算代价太大）。
* 所以，训练时我们是**随机抽取一些小的“块（chunk）”**，每次训练一个小块。
* 这样做可以降低计算成本，模型也能“见多识广”，学到整体模式。

---

### 2️⃣ Block size（块长度）

* 这些“块”都有一个固定的长度，叫 **block size**（也叫 context length）。
* 例如这里设成 8，意思是我们拿 8 个字符做“上下文”去预测后面的字符。
* 实际代码中会取 block size + 1 个字符 —— 比如拿 9 个字符，其实包含了 8 个训练样本。

---

### 3️⃣ 一个块里面其实有多个训练样本

举例，拿 9 个字符：

```
"To be or "
```

拆成训练样本，其实是**多个位置的预测任务**：

* 用第 1 个字符 → 预测第 2 个字符
* 用前 2 个字符 → 预测第 3 个字符
* 用前 3 个字符 → 预测第 4 个字符
* ...
* 用前 8 个字符 → 预测第 9 个字符

所以：**一个 chunk 里包含多个训练样本**。

---

### 4️⃣ 为什么这么设计？

* 不是只为了提高效率
* 还希望模型**适应不同长度的上下文**
* 因为实际生成时，可能刚开始只有 1 个字符，逐渐扩展上下文长度
* 训练时模型就学会了如何在不同 context 长度下预测下一个 token

---

### 5️⃣ 批处理（Batch）

除了一个 chunk 里有多个训练样本，还要做 **Batch 训练**：

* 一次训练不仅处理 1 个 chunk，而是同时处理很多 chunk，组成一个 batch
* 这样可以充分利用 GPU 的并行计算能力，提高训练速度

代码里例子是：

* batch\_size = 4（一次处理 4 个 chunk）
* block\_size = 8（每个 chunk 长度 8）

所以：

* 每次送进 Transformer 的数据是一个 4 x 8 的 tensor（4 个样本，每个 8 个 token）
* 对应的 target 也是一个 4 x 8 的 tensor，表示每个 token 位置的“正确答案”

---

### 6️⃣ 随机采样 chunk

* 每次训练，都会**随机从训练集里抽出若干位置（offset）**，拿出来组成 batch
* 这样模型不会记住某段特定位置的内容，能更好泛化

---

### 7️⃣ 总结整个流程

1️⃣ 把整个文本编码成整数序列（大数组）
2️⃣ 训练时：

* 随机抽取 batch\_size 个 offset
* 对每个 offset，取 block\_size + 1 个 token → 形成 chunk
* 生成对应的 X（输入） 和 Y（目标）
  3️⃣ X 和 Y 就可以送进 Transformer 做训练了

---

### 8️⃣ Transformer 如何处理

* X：就是 4 x 8 个 token（4 个 chunk，每 chunk 8 个 token）
* Transformer 用来预测：X 里每一位置“下一个 token”是什么 → 对应 Y 中的值
* 每一个 (X\[i,j], Y\[i,j]) 就是一个训练样本

---

这样就完成了 **Data Loader 的核心设计**，模型训练就能稳定进行。

---

如果你需要的话，我还可以帮你画个**数据流示意图**，或者整理一个 **batch + chunk + context** 的总结表，帮助你更好记住！要不要我整理一下？ 🌟

```python
def get_batch(split):
    # generate a small batch of data of inputs x and targets y
    data = train_data if split == 'train' else val_data
    ix = torch.randint(len(data) - block_size, (batch_size,))
    x = torch.stack([data[i:i+block_size] for i in ix])
    y = torch.stack([data[i+1:i+block_size+1] for i in ix])
    return x, y
```

解释一下


当然可以，下面我帮你详细解释一下这一段代码 `get_batch(split)`：

---

### 📌 函数功能：

**生成一个 batch 的输入数据 (x) 和对应的目标数据 (y)**，供模型训练用。

---

### 📌 输入参数：

`split` —— 字符串，决定是用训练集（'train'）还是验证集（'val'）

---

### 📌 具体步骤：

#### ① 选数据集

```python
data = train_data if split == 'train' else val_data
```

如果参数是 'train'，就用 `train_data`；
如果是 'val'，就用 `val_data`。

---

#### ② 生成 batch\_size 个随机起始位置

```python
ix = torch.randint(len(data) - block_size, (batch_size,))
```

* `torch.randint` 生成 batch\_size 个随机整数，范围是 \[0, len(data) - block\_size)。
* 这些整数是**chunk 的起始位置**。
* 为什么减掉 block\_size？因为后面要取出长度为 block\_size + 1 的片段，不能越界。

---

#### ③ 构建输入序列 x

```python
x = torch.stack([data[i:i+block_size] for i in ix])
```

* 对每个随机位置 i，取出从 `i` 到 `i+block_size` 的片段。
* 用 list comprehension 处理 batch\_size 个位置。
* 用 `torch.stack` 把它们堆叠成一个 batch，shape 是 `(batch_size, block_size)`。
* 这个 `x` 就是 Transformer 的输入（每行是一个 chunk）。

---

#### ④ 构建目标序列 y

```python
y = torch.stack([data[i+1:i+block_size+1] for i in ix])
```

* 和 `x` 类似，不过偏移 1 个字符，表示\*\*“正确答案”\*\*：

  * 对于 x 里的每一个 token，y 里对应位置存的是**下一个 token**。
* 这样模型训练时，就是学会**预测下一个 token**。

---

#### ⑤ 返回 x, y

```python
return x, y
```

* 返回值 x, y，shape 都是 `(batch_size, block_size)`
* 可以直接喂进 Transformer 训练，计算 loss。

---

### 📌 举个简单例子：

假设：

```
batch_size = 2  
block_size = 4  
data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]  
```

假设采样出两个位置：

```
ix = [2, 5]  
```

那对应的 batch 就是：

**x：**

```
[ data[2:6] ] -> [3,4,5,6]  
[ data[5:9] ] -> [6,7,8,9]  
```

**y：**

```
[ data[3:7] ] -> [4,5,6,7]  
[ data[6:10] ] -> [7,8,9,10]  
```

---

### 📌 总结一句话：

这个 `get_batch()` 函数就是：
**随机选 batch\_size 个位置，取出 block\_size 长度的 x 和对应的 y，作为一个 batch 输入模型训练。**

---

如果你想，我也可以补充一下：
✅ 为什么要用 offset 1 作为 y？
✅ batch\_size 和 block\_size 设置成多少合适？
✅ 训练过程中 get\_batch 怎么配合 optimizer 用？

要不要我再详细讲讲？ 🌟


# simplest baseline: bigram language model, loss, generation

Transformer let's start basically feeding this into neural networks now we're going to start off with the
simplest possible neural network which in the case of language modeling in my opinion is the Byram language model and
we've covered the Byram language model in my make more series in a lot of depth and so here I'm going to sort of go
faster and let's just Implement pytorch module directly that implements the byr language
model so I'm importing the pytorch um NN module uh for
reproducibility and then here I'm constructing a Byram language model which is a subass of NN
module and then I'm calling it and I'm passing it the inputs and the targets
and I'm just printing now when the inputs on targets come here you see that I'm just taking the index uh the inputs
X here which I rename to idx and I'm just passing them into this token embedding table so it's going on here is
that here in the Constructor we are creating a token embedding table and it
is of size vocap size by vocap size and we're using an. embedding which
is a very thin wrapper around basically a tensor of shape voap size by vocab size and what's happening here is that
when we pass idx here every single integer in our input is going to refer to this embedding table and it's going
to pluck out a row of that embedding table corresponding to its index so 24
here will go into the embedding table and we'll pluck out the 24th row and then 43 will go here and pluck out the
43d row Etc and then pytorch is going to arrange all of this into a batch by Time
by channel uh tensor in this case batch is four time is eight and C which is the
channels is vocab size or 65 and so we're just going to pluck out all those rows arrange them in a b by T by C and
now we're going to interpret this as the logits which are basically the scores for the next character in the sequence
and so what's happening here is we are predicting what comes next based on just the individual identity of a single
token and you can do that because um I mean currently the tokens are not talking to each other and they're not
seeing any context except for they're just seeing themselves so I'm a f I'm a token number five and then I can
actually make pretty decent predictions about what comes next just by knowing that I'm token five because some characters uh know um C follow other
characters in in typical scenarios so we saw a lot of this in a lot more depth in the make more series and here if I just
run this then we currently get the predictions the scores the lits for
every one of the 4x8 positions now that we've made predictions about what comes next we'd like to evaluate the loss
function and so in make more series we saw that a good way to measure a loss or like a quality of the predictions is to
use the negative log likelihood loss which is also implemented in pytorch under the name cross entropy so what we'
like to do here is loss is the cross entropy on the predictions and the
targets and so this measures the quality of the logits with respect to the Targets in other words we have the
identity of the next character so how well are we predicting the next character based on the lits and
intuitively the correct um the correct dimension of low jits uh depending on
whatever the target is should have a very high number and all the other dimensions should be very low number
right now the issue is that this won't actually this is what we want we want to basically output the logits and the
loss this is what we want but unfortunately uh this won't actually run
we get an error message but intuitively we want to uh measure this now when we
go to the pytorch um cross entropy documentation here um we're trying to
call the cross entropy in its functional form uh so that means we don't have to create like a module for it but here
when we go to the documentation you have to look into the details of how pitor expects these inputs and basically the
issue here is ptor expects if you have multi-dimensional input which we do because we have a b BYT by C tensor then
it actually really wants the channels to be the second uh Dimension here so if
you um so basically it wants a b by C BYT instead of a b by T by C and so it's
just the details of how P torch treats um these kinds of inputs and so we don't
actually want to deal with that so what we're going to do instead is we need to basically reshape our logits so here's
what I like to do I like to take basically give names to the dimensions so lit. shape is B BYT by C and unpack
those numbers and then let's uh say that logits equals lit. View and we want it
to be a b * c b * T by C so just a two- dimensional
array right so we're going to take all the we're going to take all of these um
positions here and we're going to uh stretch them out in a onedimensional sequence and uh preserve the channel
Dimension as the second dimension so we're just kind of like stretching out the array so it's two- dimensional and in that case it's going
to better conform to what pytorch uh sort of expects in its Dimensions now we
have to do the same to targets because currently targets are um of shape B by T
and we want it to be just B * T so onedimensional now alternatively you
could always still just do minus one because pytor will guess what this should be if you want to lay it out uh
but let me just be explicit and say p * t once we've reshaped this it will match the cross entropy case and then we
should be able to evaluate our loss okay so that R now and we can do
loss and So currently we see that the loss is 4.87 now because our uh we have 65
possible vocabulary elements we can actually guess at what the loss should be and in
particular we covered negative log likelihood in a lot of detail we are expecting log or lawn of um 1 over 65
and negative of that so we're expecting the loss to be about 4.1 17 but we're
getting 4.87 and so that's telling us that the initial predictions are not uh super diffuse they've got a little bit
of entropy and so we're guessing wrong uh so uh yes but actually we're I a we
are able to evaluate the loss okay so now that we can evaluate the quality of the model on some data we'd like to also
be able to generate from the model so let's do the generation now I'm going to go again a little bit faster here
because I covered all this already in previous videos so here's a generate function for the
model so we take some uh we take the the same kind of input idx here and
basically this is the current uh context of some characters in a batch in some
batch so it's also B BYT and the job of generate is to basically take this B BYT
and extend it to be B BYT + 1 plus 2 plus 3 and so it's just basically it continues the generation in all the
batch dimensions in the time Dimension So that's its job and it will do that for Max new tokens so you can see here
on the bottom there's going to be some stuff here but on the bottom whatever is predicted is concatenated on top of the
previous idx along the First Dimension which is the time Dimension to create a b BYT + one so that becomes a new idx so
the job of generate is to take a b BYT and make it a b BYT plus 1 plus 2 plus three as many as we want Max new tokens
so this is the generation from the model now inside the generation what what are we doing we're taking the current
indices we're getting the predictions so we get uh those are in the low jits and
then the loss here is going to be ignored because um we're not we're not using that and we have no targets that
are sort of ground truth targets that we're going to be comparing with then once we get the logits we are only
focusing on the last step so instead of a b by T by C we're going to pluck out
the negative-1 the last element in the time Dimension because those are the predictions for what comes next so that
gives us the logits which we then convert to probabilities via softmax and then we use tor. multinomial to sample
from those probabilities and we ask pytorch to give us one sample and so idx
next will become a b by one because in each uh one of the batch Dimensions
we're going to have a single prediction for what comes next so this num samples equals one will make this be a
one and then we're going to take those integers that come from the sampling process according to the probability
distribution given here and those integers got just concatenated on top of the current sort of like running stream
of integers and this gives us a b BYT + one and then we can return that now one
thing here is you see how I'm calling self of idx which will end up going to
the forward function I'm not providing any Targets So currently this would give an error because targets is uh is uh
sort of like not given so targets has to be optional so targets is none by default and then if targets is none then
there's no loss to create so it's just loss is none but else all of this
happens and we can create a loss so this will make it so um if we have the
targets we provide them and get a loss if we have no targets it will'll just get the loits so this here will generate from
the model um and let's take that for a ride
now oops so I have another code chunk here which will generate for the model
from the model and okay this is kind of crazy so maybe let me let me break this down so these are the idx
right I'm creating a batch will be just one time will be just one so I'm
creating a little one by one tensor and it's holding a zero and the D type the
data type is uh integer so zero is going to be how we kick off the generation and
remember that zero is uh is the element standing for a new line character so
it's kind of like a reasonable thing to to feed in as the very first character in a sequence to be the new
line um so it's going to be idx which we're going to feed in here then we're going to ask for 100 tokens
and then. generate will continue that now because uh generate works on the
level of batches we we then have to index into the zero throw to basically unplug the um the single batch Dimension
that exists and then that gives us a um
time steps just a onedimensional array of all the indices which we will convert to simple python list from pytorch
tensor so that that can feed into our decode function and uh convert those
integers into text so let me bring this back and we're generating 100 tokens let's
run and uh here's the generation that we achieved so obviously it's garbage and
the reason it's garbage is because this is a totally random model so next up we're going to want to train this model
now one more thing I wanted to point out here is this function is written to be General but it's kind of like ridiculous
right now because we're feeding in all this we're building out this context and we're concatenating
it all and we're always feeding it all into the model but that's kind of
ridiculous because this is just a simple Byram model so to make for example this prediction about K we only needed this W
but actually what we fed into the model is we fed the entire sequence and then we only looked at the very last piece
and predicted K so the only reason I'm writing it in this way is because right now this is a byr model but I'd like to
keep keep this function fixed and I'd like it to work um later when our
characters actually um basically look further in the history and so right now
the history is not used so this looks silly uh but eventually the history will be used and so that's why we want to uh
do it this way so just a quick comment on that so now we see that this is um random so let's train the model so it
becomes a bit less random okay let's Now train the model so first what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a pyour

当然可以！这一段讲的是**最简单的语言模型 —— bigram 语言模型**，以及如何计算 loss 和做生成。我帮你详细拆解一下：

---

### 📌 什么是 bigram 语言模型？

bigram 模型的意思是：
**“根据当前这个字符，预测下一个字符。”**
它没有用更长的上下文，**只看当前位置的字符**，预测下一个。

---

### 📌 网络结构

作者从最简单的模型开始，直接用 PyTorch 定义一个 `BigramLanguageModel` 类（继承 `nn.Module`）：

```python
class BigramLanguageModel(nn.Module):
```

#### 1️⃣ token embedding table

在 `__init__` 里创建了一个 **token embedding 表**，形状是 `(vocab_size, vocab_size)`：

```python
self.token_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, vocab_size)
```

* 本质上就是一个 **词表大小 × 词表大小** 的矩阵。
* 输入是一个 token 的索引，比如 24，
  → 它会把 embedding table 里第 24 行拿出来作为 embedding。
* 这样 batch 里的每个 token，都会被映射成一个 vocab\_size 维的向量。

---

### 📌 forward 过程

* `x` 输入形状是 `(batch_size, block_size)`，就是一批 token 序列。
* 经过 embedding，变成 `(batch_size, block_size, vocab_size)`，相当于为每个位置都预测出“下一个 token 各类别的打分（logits）”。

```python
logits = self.token_embedding_table(idx)  # shape: (B, T, vocab_size)
```

* 但 bigram 模型本身其实 **只用当前 token 来预测下一个 token**，并不看上下文。

---

### 📌 计算 loss

训练时需要定义一个损失函数，衡量预测和目标的差距。

常用的就是 **交叉熵（cross entropy）**，PyTorch 里有现成的 `F.cross_entropy`。

#### 但是要注意形状问题：

* PyTorch 期望输入 logits 形状是 `(batch_size, vocab_size, block_size)`，
  而 bigram 模型当前输出的是 `(batch_size, block_size, vocab_size)`，所以要 reshape。

```python
logits = logits.view(batch_size * block_size, vocab_size)
targets = targets.view(batch_size * block_size)
```

* reshape 后，可以直接用 `F.cross_entropy(logits, targets)` 计算 loss。

---

### 📌 结果分析

* 一开始随机初始化的模型，loss 大概是 4.87
* 理论上，如果模型是完全随机的，loss 应该接近 **`-ln(1/65) ≈ 4.17`**，
  因为词表有 65 个字符，完全随机预测的交叉熵就是这个值。
* 所以 4.87 比 4.17 大一些，说明模型还没开始学习。

---

### 📌 文本生成（generation）

作者实现了一个 `generate()` 函数，能根据当前输入序列，逐步往后生成更多 token。

#### 生成流程：

1️⃣ 给一个初始 token `idx`（比如换行符，0）
2️⃣ 每一步：

* 用模型算 logits
* 只取 logits 的最后一个时间步（最后一个 token）
* 用 softmax 转成概率分布
* 随机 sample 出一个 token
* 把这个新 token 接到序列后面
  3️⃣ 重复这个过程 N 步，就可以生成长度为 N 的序列。

---

### 📌 为什么写成这样？

* 现在这个 bigram 模型其实 “只看当前 token”，历史 token 并没用。
* 但是作者故意把 generate() 写成能处理任意长度上下文（把历史拼上去），
  因为 **后面我们会升级成 Transformer**，那时历史 token 就会用到了。
* 提前把框架写好，后面不用改代码。

---

### 📌 小结：

* 现在这个 bigram 语言模型非常简单，只能学“两个字符之间的关系”，没法学长距离上下文。
* 生成出来的文本是“垃圾”，因为模型还没训练好。
* 下一步就是要训练这个模型，让它慢慢学会 tiny Shakespeare 里的字符关系。

---

如果你需要，我还可以补充：
✅ 为什么 bigram 是语言建模里最简单的 baseline？
✅ 为什么 logits 要 reshape？
✅ bigram 生成的文本会有什么特点？

要不要我再详细讲讲？ 🌟

print(decode(m.generate(idx = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long), max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist()))

解释一下

好，这句代码我帮你详细解释一下：

```python
print(decode(m.generate(idx = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long), max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist()))
```

---

### 📌 这一句整体在做什么？

👉 **用 bigram 模型 m 生成 100 个 token，转成字符串，打印出来。**

---

### 📌 逐步拆解

---

#### 1️⃣ `torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long)`

```python
idx = torch.zeros((1, 1), dtype=torch.long)
```

* 构造一个 `(1, 1)` 的 tensor，里面填 0，整数类型（long）。
* 含义是：**batch size = 1，序列长度 = 1，初始 token = 0**。

通常 0 是换行符 `\n`，作为“起始 token”很合理。

---

#### 2️⃣ 调用 generate()

```python
m.generate(idx, max_new_tokens=100)
```

* 调用模型的 `generate()` 函数，
* 初始序列是 `[0]`，
* **连续生成 100 个新的 token**，拼接在原序列后面。

返回结果 shape 是：

```python
(idx.shape) → (1, 1 + 100) → (1, 101)
```

也就是：

```
[[ 0, 34, 5, 9, 18, 12, ..., 21 ]]  ← 一条生成出来的 token 序列
```

---

#### 3️⃣ `[0]`

```python
... [0]
```

* 取出 batch 里的第一个序列（因为 batch\_size=1）
* 得到 1 维 array，shape 是 `(101,)`，101 个 token id

---

#### 4️⃣ `.tolist()`

```python
.tolist()
```

* 把 PyTorch tensor 转成 python list，方便 decode。

例如：

```
[0, 34, 5, 9, 18, 12, ..., 21]
```

---

#### 5️⃣ `decode()`

```python
decode([...])
```

* 把 token id 列表 → 转换成字符串。
* decode 过程是根据之前的 **token\_to\_char 映射表**，把 token id 还原成字符。

---

#### 6️⃣ print()

```python
print(...)
```

* 打印出生成的字符串。

---

### 📌 举个例子

假设生成结果是：

```
[0, 34, 5, 9, 18, 12, 7, 22, ...]
```

decode 后得到字符串：

```
"\nABcdefGH..."
```

最终打印出来就是：

```
ABcdefGH...
```

---

### 📌 总结一句话

这一整句代码：

```python
print(decode(m.generate(torch.zeros((1,1), dtype=torch.long), max_new_tokens=100)[0].tolist()))
```

的作用是：

👉 **“从 token 0 开始，调用 bigram 语言模型生成 100 个 token，转成字符，打印出来。”**

---

如果你还想，我可以继续讲讲：

✅ 为什么需要 tolist()？
✅ 为什么 batch size = 1？
✅ 这个生成结果通常看起来像什么？ bigram 模型 vs Transformer 差别大吗？

要不要我再详细讲一讲？🌟



# training the bigram model

optimization object so here we are using the optimizer ATM W um now in a make
more series we've only ever use tastic gradi in descent the simplest possible Optimizer which you can get using the
SGD instead but I want to use Adam which is a much more advanced and popular Optimizer and it works extremely well
for uh typical good setting for the learning rate is roughly 3 E4 uh but for
very very small networks like is the case here you can get away with much much higher learning rates R3 or even
higher probably but let me create the optimizer object which will basically take the gradients and uh update the
parameters using the gradients and then here our batch size
up above was only four so let me actually use something bigger let's say 32 and then for some number of steps um
we are sampling a new batch of data we're evaluating the loss uh we're zeroing out all the gradients from the
previous step getting the gradients for all the parameters and then using those gradients to up update our parameters so
typical training loop as we saw in the make more series so let me now uh run
this for say 100 iterations and let's see what kind of losses we're going to
get so we started around 4.7 and now we're getting to down to like 4.6 4.5 Etc so the optimization is
definitely happening but um let's uh sort of try to increase number of
iterations and only print at the end because we probably want train for
longer okay so we're down to 3.6
roughly roughly down to
three this is the most janky
optimization okay it's working let's just do 10,000 and then from here we want to
copy this and hopefully that we're going to get something reason and of course it's not going to be Shakespeare from a
byr model but at least we see that the loss is improving and uh hopefully we're
expecting something a bit more reasonable okay so we're down at about 2.5 is let's see what we get okay
dramatic improvements certainly on what we had here so let me just increase the number of tokens okay so we see that
we're starting to get something at least like reasonable is
um certainly not shakes spear but uh the model is making progress so that is the
simplest possible model so now what I'd like to do
is obviously this is a very simple model because the tokens are not talking to each other so given the previous context
of whatever was generated we're only looking at the very last character to make the predictions about what comes next so now these uh now these tokens
have to start talking to each other and figuring out what is in the context so that they can make better predictions
for what comes next and this is how we're going to kick off the uh Transformer okay so next I took the code

当然可以！我来帮你详细讲讲这一段【训练 bigram 语言模型】的内容：

---

### 📌 这一段在讲什么？

👉 **如何用优化器（Optimizer）训练 bigram 语言模型**，让它的 loss 下降，模型“学会”更好地预测下一个 token。

---

### 📌 优化器选择

* 在之前的 `makemore` 系列里，作者只用过最简单的优化器 **SGD（随机梯度下降）**：

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
```

* 但这次作者用的是更高级的 **Adam** 优化器：

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
```

**Adam 优化器**：

* 是目前深度学习里非常常用的优化器，
* 收敛更快，效果更稳定，
* 不容易因为学习率选不好而震荡。

---

### 📌 学习率（learning rate）

* 通常来说，learning rate 可以设成：

```
3e-4 = 0.0003  
```

* 但是 bigram 模型非常简单，网络规模很小，所以可以用更高的学习率，比如 `3` 甚至更高，训练更快收敛。

---

### 📌 batch size

* 原来 batch\_size=4，太小了，作者改成了：

```
batch_size = 32
```

* 用大一些的 batch\_size，训练更稳定，梯度估计更准确。

---

### 📌 训练循环（Training loop）

核心流程：

```text
循环 N 次：
    1. 采样一个新的 batch
    2. 计算 loss
    3. 清零上一步的梯度
    4. 反向传播（backpropagation），算出当前梯度
    5. 用 Adam 优化器更新模型参数
```

---

### 📌 训练效果

* 刚开始 loss 大约是 4.7
* 训练几百步后，下降到 4.5、4.0 …
* 训练 10000 步以后，loss 大约降到 2.5

---

### 📌 生成效果

* 开始时 bigram 模型生成的文本是垃圾（全随机）
* 训练一段时间后，虽然还不是莎士比亚，但能生成“看起来稍微合理”的字符序列，loss 也在变小
* 说明模型开始学习到了 tiny Shakespeare 数据集里的 **字符 co-occurrence 规律**（哪些字符经常跟哪些字符搭配）

---

### 📌 为什么 bigram 模型效果有限？

* bigram 语言模型 **“只用当前 token”** 预测下一个 token
* 不看前文上下文，预测能力有限
* 所以生成的文本 **没有长距离的逻辑、语法、句法结构**
* 作者说：“tokens 没有相互‘对话’，模型只看最后一个字符，无法捕捉上下文”

---

### 📌 下一步计划

作者准备**引入 Transformer**：

* 让 tokens 能互相“交流”，
* Transformer 能利用更长的上下文，学到更复杂的结构 → 预测效果会更好

---

### 📌 总结一句话

这一段是教你：

👉 **如何用 Adam 优化器训练 bigram 语言模型，loss 逐步下降，生成效果越来越合理**，但受限于 bigram 本身只能看到当前 token，模型能力有限 → 下一步改用 Transformer。

---

如果你还想，我可以继续讲：

✅ 为什么 bigram loss 大约可以降到 2.5？
✅ 为什么 batch size 大会训练更稳定？
✅ 为什么 bigram 不足以生成“像莎士比亚”的文本？

# port our code to a script

that we developed in this juper notebook and I converted it to be a script and I'm doing this because I just want to
simplify our intermediate work into just the final product that we have at this point so in the top here I put all the
hyp parameters that we to find I introduced a few and I'm going to speak to that in a little bit otherwise a lot
of this should be recognizable uh reproducibility read data get the encoder and the decoder create the train
into splits uh use the uh kind of like data loader um that gets a batch of the
inputs and Targets this is new and I'll talk about it in a second now this is
the Byram language model that we developed and it can forward and give us a logits and loss and it can
generate and then here we are creating the optimizer and this is the training
Loop so everything here should look pretty familiar now some of the small things that I added number one I added
the ability to run on a GPU if you have it so if you have a GPU then you can this will use Cuda instead of just CPU
and everything will be a lot more faster now when device becomes Cuda then we need to make sure that when we load the
data we move it to device when we create the model we want to move uh the model parameters to
device so as an example here we have the N an embedding table and it's got a
weight inside it which stores the uh sort of lookup table so so that would be moved to the GPU so that all the
calculations here happen on the GPU and they can be a lot faster and then finally here when I'm creating the
context that feeds in to generate I have to make sure that I create it on the device number two what I introduced is
uh the fact that here in the training Loop here I was just printing the um l.
item inside the training Loop but this is a very noisy measurement of the current loss because every batch will be
more or less lucky and so what I want to do usually um is uh I have an estimate
loss function and the estimate loss basically then um goes up here and it
averages up the loss over multiple batches so in particular we're going to iterate eval iter times and we're going
to basically get our loss and then we're going to get the average loss for both splits and so this will be a lot less
noisy so here when we call the estimate loss we're we're going to report the uh pretty accurate train and validation
loss now when we come back up you'll notice a few things here I'm setting the model to evaluation phase and down here
I'm resetting it back to training phase now right now for our model as is this doesn't actually do anything because the
only thing inside this model is this uh nn. embedding and um this this um
Network would behave both would behave the same in both evaluation mode and training mode we have no drop off layers
we have no batm layers Etc but it is a good practice to Think Through what mode your neural network is in because some
layers will have different Behavior Uh at inference time or training time and
there's also this context manager torch up nograd and this is just telling pytorch that everything that happens
inside this function we will not call do backward on and so pytorch can be a lot
more efficient with its memory use because it doesn't have to store all the intermediate variables uh because we're
never going to call backward and so it can it can be a lot more memory efficient in that way so also a good
practice to tpy torch when we don't intend to do back propagation so right now this script is
about 120 lines of code of and that's kind of our starter code I'm calling it
b.p and I'm going to release it later now running this script gives us output in the terminal
and it looks something like this it basically as I ran this code uh it was
giving me the train loss and Val loss and we see that we convert to somewhere around 2.5 with the pyr model and then here's
the sample that we produced at the end and so we have everything packaged up in the script and we're in a good
position now to iterate on this okay so we are almost ready to start writing our very first self attention block for

当然可以，我来帮你详细解释这一段【把 bigram 训练代码转成脚本】的内容：

---

### 📌 主要内容

👉 **把之前在 Jupyter Notebook 里写的代码，整理成一个 Python 脚本文件**（比如 `bigram.py`），方便以后复用、扩展、优化。

---

### 📌 为什么要转成脚本？

* Notebook 里代码是一步一步写的，适合演示和调试
* 脚本（.py 文件）更适合做**完整的训练流程**，可以方便在命令行跑、复现结果
* 作为“阶段性版本”，把目前写好的 bigram 模型收拾干净，准备继续扩展（比如后面加 self-attention）

---

### 📌 脚本内容结构

---

#### 1️⃣ 超参数

```python
# 把超参数集中写在脚本最上方
# 例如 batch_size, block_size, learning_rate, max_iters, etc.
```

---

#### 2️⃣ 数据处理

* 读数据
* 生成 encode/decode 函数
* 划分 train / val 数据
* data\_loader：实现 get\_batch()，每次从数据里取 batch

---

#### 3️⃣ bigram 模型

```python
# 直接用我们之前写的 BigramLanguageModel
# 包括 forward() 和 generate() 两个方法
```

---

#### 4️⃣ 优化器

```python
# 选用 Adam 优化器
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
```

---

#### 5️⃣ 训练循环（training loop）

```text
for step in range(max_iters):
    1. get_batch
    2. forward pass
    3. compute loss
    4. backward pass
    5. optimizer.step()
```

---

#### 6️⃣ 新增内容：支持 GPU 训练

```python
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
```

* 自动检测有没有 GPU，有的话用 GPU，可以快很多
* 需要把：

  * 数据 tensor `.to(device)`
  * 模型 `.to(device)`
  * 生成的时候的 context tensor 也要 `.to(device)`

---

#### 7️⃣ 新增内容：estimate\_loss 函数

* 原来训练 loop 里直接打印 loss，**太 noisy（波动大）**
* 现在定义一个 `estimate_loss()` 函数，做多次 batch 求平均，结果更平滑、更准确
* 每隔几步打印平均的 train\_loss 和 val\_loss

---

#### 8️⃣ 训练 / 推理模式切换

```python
model.eval()  # 评估模式
model.train()  # 训练模式
```

* 目前 bigram 模型里用不到（没有 dropout / batchnorm）
* 但是**养成好习惯**，因为后面 Transformer 里需要切换模式

---

#### 9️⃣ with torch.no\_grad()

```python
with torch.no_grad():
```

* 生成文本时不会用到反向传播
* 用 `no_grad` 可以节省内存，加快推理速度
* 也是良好的 PyTorch 习惯

---

### 📌 运行脚本的效果

* 脚本大约 120 行左右
* 运行后，控制台会看到：

```text
step 1000: train loss 3.2, val loss 3.1
step 2000: train loss 2.7, val loss 2.6
step 3000: train loss 2.5, val loss 2.5
...
```

* 最终 loss 大约降到 2.5（bigram 模型极限）
* 末尾会生成一段文本，明显比初始未训练时的“乱码”更合理

---

### 📌 最终总结

这一段讲的是：

👉 **把 bigram 训练过程封装成干净的 Python 脚本 bigram.py**
👉 支持 GPU
👉 支持平滑评估 loss
👉 训练到 2.5 loss 左右，准备进入下一步 —— **实现 self-attention block，升级为 Transformer！**

---

如果你还想，我可以继续讲讲：

✅ 为什么加了 estimate\_loss，效果更好？
✅ 为什么模型 eval() / train() 很重要？
✅ 为什么 bigram loss 极限大概在 2.5？

要不要我再补充？🌟


# version 1: averaging past context with for loops, the weakest form of aggregation

processing these uh tokens now before we actually get there I want to get you
used to a mathematical trick that is used in the self attention inside a Transformer and is really just like at
the heart of an an efficient implementation of self attention and so I want to work with this toy example to
just get you used to this operation and then it's going to make it much more clear once we actually get to um to it
uh in the script again so let's create a b BYT by C where BT and C are just 48 and two in the toy
example and these are basically channels and we have uh batches and we have the
time component and we have information at each point in the sequence so
see now what we would like to do is we would like these um tokens so we have up
to eight tokens here in a batch and these eight tokens are currently not talking to each other and we would like
them to talk to each other we'd like to couple them and in particular we don't
we we want to couple them in a very specific way so the token for example at the fifth location it should not
communicate with tokens in the sixth seventh and eighth location because uh those are future tokens in
the sequence the token on the fifth location should only talk to the one in the fourth third second and first so
it's only so information only flows from previous context to the current time step and we cannot get any information
from the future because we are about to try to predict the future so what is the easiest way for
tokens to communicate okay the easiest way I would say is okay if we're up to
if we're a fifth token and I'd like to communicate with my past the simplest way we can do that is to just do a
weight is to just do an average of all the um of all the preceding elements so
for example if I'm the fif token I would like to take the channels uh that make up that are information at my step but
then also the channels from the fourth step third step second step and the first step I'd like to average those up
and then that would become sort of like a feature Vector that summarizes me in the context of my history now of course
just doing a sum or like an average is an extremely weak form of interaction like this communication is uh extremely
lossy we've lost a ton of information about the spatial Arrangements of all those tokens uh but that's okay for now
we'll see how we can bring that information back later for now what we would like to do is for every single
batch element independently for every teeth token in that sequence we'd like
to now calculate the average of all the vectors in all the previous tokens and
also at this token so let's write that out um I have a small snippet here and
instead of just fumbling around let me just copy paste it and talk to it so in other words we're going to
create X and B is short for bag of words because bag of words is um is kind of
like um a term that people use when you are just averaging up things so this is just a bag of words basically there's a
word stored on every one of these eight locations and we're doing a bag of words we're just averaging
so in the beginning we're going to say that it's just initialized at Zero and then I'm doing a for Loop here so we're not being efficient yet that's coming
but for now we're just iterating over all the batch Dimensions independently iterating over time and then the
previous uh tokens are at this uh batch Dimension and then everything up to and
including the teeth token okay so when we slice out X in this way X prev
Becomes of shape um how many T elements there were in the past and then of
course C so all the two-dimensional information from these little tokens so
that's the previous uh sort of chunk of um tokens from my current sequence and
then I'm just doing the average or the mean over the zero Dimension so I'm averaging out the time here and I'm just
going to get a little c one dimensional Vector which I'm going to store in X bag of words so I can run this and and uh
this is not going to be very informative because let's see so this is X of Zer so
this is the zeroth batch element and then expo at zero now you see how the at
the first location here you see that the two are equal and that's because it's we're just doing an average of this one
token but here this one is now an average of these two and now this one is
an average of these three and so on so uh and this last one is the average
of all of these elements so vertical average just averaging up all the tokens now gives this outcome
here so this is all well and good uh but this is very inefficient now the trick

当然可以，我来帮你详细拆解这一段内容：

---

### 📌 这一段在讲什么？

👉 **在正式写 self-attention 之前，先通过一个简单例子理解 self-attention 背后的“矩阵技巧”**
👉 目标是让你先习惯“序列中的 token 如何相互通信”这个思想。

---

### 📌 为什么要做这个例子？

* 当前我们训练的 bigram 模型里 **token 之间是独立的**，互相之间“看不到对方”。
* 想要更强大的模型，token 之间必须能“交流” —— 当前 token 要能“看到”前面的 token，才更容易预测下一个 token。
* Transformer 中的 self-attention 就是实现这种“交流”的机制。
* 但 self-attention 里面的实现技巧，很多是用矩阵运算写的，可能一开始不直观。
* 所以作者用这个**for 循环版本**的例子，先带你理解“token 如何聚合前面信息”这个思想，之后再优化成矩阵乘法。

---

### 📌 小例子设置

```
B = 4  # batch size
T = 8  # sequence length
C = 2  # channels / embedding 维度
```

创建一个 (B, T, C) 的张量 `x`，可以理解为：

```
batch 里有 B 条序列  
每条序列长度是 T（有 T 个 token）  
每个 token 用 C 维向量表示  
```

---

### 📌 我们要做什么？

对于 **序列中的第 t 个 token**，我们希望它能“看见”前面的 token，
具体做法：

* 对第 t 个 token，取出它前面所有 token（包括自己）
* **把这些 token 的向量做“平均”**，作为新的特征向量

换句话说：

```
第5个 token → 平均 [第1,2,3,4,5个 token 的 embedding 向量]  
```

---

### 📌 为什么要做平均？

* 平均是一种**最简单的“信息聚合”方法**
* 当然，平均是很弱的（信息损失很大），但这个例子只是为了帮助理解
* 之后我们会用 self-attention 学出更聪明的聚合方式（加权求和，权重由模型学出来）

---

### 📌 为什么不能看未来 token？

* 因为语言模型是“自回归”的：
  → 只能用“已有的上下文”预测下一个 token，不能偷看“未来”
* 所以只聚合 **当前位置之前的 token**，不能用未来 token

---

### 📌 for 循环版实现思路

对 batch 里的每一条序列，做：

```
for b in range(B):
    for t in range(T):
        x_prev = x[b, :t+1, :]  # 取出前 t 个 token（含当前）
        avg = x_prev.mean(dim=0)  # 对时间维做平均
        x_bagofwords[b, t] = avg  # 存到新 tensor
```

---

### 📌 举例

如果某一条序列是：

```
token 1: [0.2, 0.4]  
token 2: [0.6, 0.3]  
token 3: [0.1, 0.5]  
token 4: [0.9, 0.8]  
```

那么对于 token 4，新的特征是：

```
avg( token 1, 2, 3, 4 )  
= ( [0.2,0.4] + [0.6,0.3] + [0.1,0.5] + [0.9,0.8] ) / 4
```

---

### 📌 观察结果

作者打印出来：

```
x_bagofwords[b, t]
```

可以看到：

```
t=0 → 只平均自己  
t=1 → 平均 前2个 token  
t=2 → 平均 前3个 token  
t=3 → 平均 前4个 token  
...
```

---

### 📌 目前的问题

* 用 for 循环实现效率非常低（慢）
* Transformer 里会用 **矩阵乘法** + **mask** 来实现这个过程，高效且能用 GPU 执行

---

### 📌 小结一句话

👉 这个 toy 例子是帮你理解：

**“如何把当前 token 和前面的 token 信息聚合在一起”**

✅ 用平均是最弱版本
✅ Self-attention 后面会实现更聪明的加权求和
✅ 只能看过去，不能看未来

---

如果你还想，我可以继续讲讲：

✅ 这个“平均”操作，和 self-attention 的加权和有啥区别？
✅ 为什么 self-attention 里用“矩阵乘法”能高效实现？
✅ 为啥要 mask future tokens？

要不要我再帮你细讲一下？🌟

```python
# consider the following toy example:

torch.manual_seed(1337)
B,T,C = 4,8,2 # batch, time, channels
x = torch.randn(B,T,C)
x.shape
```

为什么B,T,C叫做batch, time, channels

好问题！我来帮你解释一下，为什么这里的 **B, T, C** 叫做：

```text
B = batch  
T = time  
C = channels
```

---

### 📌 1️⃣ B = batch

```
B = 4
```

👉 **batch size**，表示“同时处理多少条数据”。

* 在训练神经网络时，为了提高效率，通常是“**批量处理**”数据，而不是一条一条处理。
* 这个批量的大小就叫 **batch size**，通常用 `B` 表示。

例子：
如果 B=4，说明这次 forward 处理 4 条数据（4 条序列）。

---

### 📌 2️⃣ T = time

```
T = 8
```

👉 **time steps**，在这里相当于“序列长度”或者“token 个数”。

* 因为我们在做 **语言模型**，输入数据是一段文本（或者 token 序列）。
* 语言模型是 **自回归的**，按 token 序列从左到右预测。
* 所以可以把 token 序列的长度看成 **时间轴**，t=0 表示第一个 token，t=1 第二个 token，…… t=T-1 表示最后一个 token。
* 所以 T 通常叫 **time steps**，也可以理解成 **sequence length**（序列长度）。

例子：
T=8 → 每条序列里有 8 个 token。

---

### 📌 3️⃣ C = channels

```
C = 2
```

👉 **channels**，也叫 **embedding 维度**，每个 token 被表示成多少维的向量。

* 语言模型里，每个 token 都会用一个向量来表示这个 token 的“意义”。
* 这个向量有多少维呢？就是 C 维。
* 这其实类似图像卷积里“通道（channels）”的概念，所以一般也叫 **channels**。
* 在 NLP 里，也叫 **embedding dim**。

例子：
C=2 → 每个 token 被表示成一个 2 维向量。

当然，实际模型里 C 一般会大很多，比如 64、128、512……

---

### 📌 综合解释

所以：

```python
x = torch.randn(B, T, C)
```

实际上就是创建了一个：

```
( batch size = 4, sequence length = 8, embedding dim = 2 )
```

的 3 维张量：

```
(4, 8, 2)
```

可以理解成：

```
batch 里有 4 条序列  
每条序列有 8 个 token  
每个 token 是 2 维向量
```

---

### 📌 为什么用这种维度？

因为 Transformer 语言模型训练时，输入 tensor 就是这种结构：

```
(B, T, C)
```

* batch 维度 B → 一次训练多少条序列
* 时间/序列维度 T → 每条序列有多少 token
* 通道/embedding 维度 C → 每个 token 是多少维向量

---

### 📌 总结一句话

```python
B, T, C = 4, 8, 2
x = torch.randn(B, T, C)
```

就是 **模拟了 Transformer 中输入的一批“token 向量序列”**，shape 是 (batch, time, channels)。

---

如果你还想，我可以继续讲讲：

✅ Transformer 里为什么用 (B, T, C) 这种 layout？
✅ 为什么 channels 维度通常选 128/256/512？
✅ 为什么叫 time steps 而不是 token steps？

要不要我再细讲一下？🌟


```python
# We want x[b,t] = mean_{i<=t} x[b,i]
xbow = torch.zeros((B,T,C))
for b in range(B):
    for t in range(T):
        xprev = x[b,:t+1] # (t,C)
        xbow[b,t] = torch.mean(xprev, 0)
```

解释一下

当然可以，这段代码其实是对刚才那个“平均上下文”的例子做了明确实现，咱们来详细拆解：

---

### 📌 目标

```python
# We want:
x[b,t] = mean_{i <= t} x[b,i]
```

意思是：

**对于第 b 条序列的第 t 个 token，
我们希望它的新特征 = 它前面所有 token（包括自己）的平均 embedding。**

---

### 📌 代码

```python
xbow = torch.zeros((B, T, C))
```

* 创建一个 **空的输出张量** `xbow`，形状 `(B, T, C)`，
* 用来存“平均后的特征”。

---

### 📌 双重 for 循环

```python
for b in range(B):      # 对 batch 里每一条序列
    for t in range(T):  # 对序列里每一个 token 位置
```

外层循环 → 遍历 batch 里的每一条序列
内层循环 → 遍历该序列的每一个 token（按时间步 T）

---

### 📌 取出前 i<=t 个 token

```python
xprev = x[b, :t+1]  # 形状 (t+1, C)
```

* 对当前序列 `b`，取出“从 0 到 t 的所有 token” → 共 t+1 个 token
* 每个 token 是 C 维向量 → 结果 shape 是 `(t+1, C)`

---

### 📌 计算平均

```python
xbow[b, t] = torch.mean(xprev, 0)  # 维度 0 上求平均
```

* 对 `xprev` 在 \*\*时间维（第 0 维）\*\*求平均
* 得到一个 C 维向量
* 存到 `xbow[b, t]` 位置

---

### 📌 举例

假设某条序列是：

| token 位置 t | embedding (C=2) 向量 |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 0          | \[0.2, 0.4]        |
| 1          | \[0.6, 0.3]        |
| 2          | \[0.1, 0.5]        |
| 3          | \[0.9, 0.8]        |

则：

* t=0 时 → 只取 token 0 → 平均 = token 0 自己
* t=1 时 → 平均 token 0 和 token 1
* t=2 时 → 平均 token 0,1,2
* t=3 时 → 平均 token 0,1,2,3

---

### 📌 为什么要这么做？

* 这是**最简单的 token 之间“交流”方式**
* 通过对前面 token 的平均，
  每个 token 得到一个“包含历史信息的表示”
* 虽然很弱（信息丢失很多），但帮助理解 Transformer 里 self-attention 的思想：

**“当前 token 怎么用前面的 token 信息来增强自己”**

---

### 📌 整体流程总结

```python
for b in range(B):
    for t in range(T):
        xbow[b, t] = 前 t 个 token 的 embedding 平均
```

得到：

```python
xbow.shape = (B, T, C)
```

这个 `xbow` 就是“历史平均增强版”的特征张量。

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 这段代码是：
**“手动用 for 循环，实现 token 之间信息流动的 toy 版 —— 当前 token 向前看，取历史 token 的平均，作为当前特征。”**

---

如果你还想，我可以顺便讲讲：

✅ 这个“平均” 和 “self-attention 加权和” 有啥关系？
✅ 为什么不能看未来 token？
✅ 这段代码的计算复杂度是多少？

要不要我再帮你讲讲？🌟


对 xprev 在 **时间维（第 0 维）**求平均 是什么意思


这个问题问得特别好，我来详细解释一下：

---

### 📌 什么叫“时间维（第 0 维）”？

咱们先看这段代码里的 `xprev`：

```python
xprev = x[b, :t+1]  # 形状 (t+1, C)
```

* `x` 本来 shape 是 `(B, T, C)`
  → 也就是 **(batch, time, channels)**
* 这里 `x[b, :t+1]` 取的是：

  * 第 b 个序列，
  * **前 t+1 个 token**，
  * 每个 token 是 C 维向量

所以 `xprev` 的 shape 是：

```
(t+1, C)
```

也就是：

| 维度 | 含义                            |
| -- | ----------------------------- |
| 0  | 时间维（token 顺序） → 有 t+1 个 token |
| 1  | channels → 每个 token 是 C 维向量   |

---

### 📌 “对时间维（第 0 维）求平均” 是什么意思？

```python
torch.mean(xprev, 0)
```

这个 `dim=0` 说明：

👉 在 **第 0 维（时间维）** 上求平均，
👉 也就是 “对所有前 t+1 个 token 的同一通道求平均”。

---

### 📌 举例

假设：

```
t+1 = 3  # 取了前 3 个 token  
C = 2    # 每个 token 是 2 维向量
```

那么 `xprev` 可能是：

```
[[0.2, 0.4],  # 第 1 个 token
 [0.6, 0.3],  # 第 2 个 token
 [0.1, 0.5]]  # 第 3 个 token
```

shape：

```
(3, 2)
```

---

执行：

```python
torch.mean(xprev, 0)
```

效果就是：

```
[ (0.2 + 0.6 + 0.1)/3, (0.4 + 0.3 + 0.5)/3 ]
```

也就是：

```
平均第 1 维（channel 0）：token1[0], token2[0], token3[0] 的平均  
平均第 2 维（channel 1）：token1[1], token2[1], token3[1] 的平均  
```

---

### 📌 形象理解

假设：

```
时间维 (token 顺序)： ↑  
channels（维度）：→  
```

对 **“时间轴上多个 token”**，在 **同一 channel 方向** 求平均，
结果就是一个 C 维向量：

```
[[token1 embedding]  
 [token2 embedding]  
 [token3 embedding]]  --→  平均 → 一个 embedding 向量
```

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 “对时间维求平均” 就是：

**“把前面 t+1 个 token 的 embedding 向量，按通道方向算平均，得到一个 C 维向量。”**

---

如果你还想，我还可以补充讲：

✅ 为什么是 dim=0？而不是 dim=1？
✅ 这个平均和 Transformer 里加权求和的关系？
✅ 用 torch.cumsum() 可以替代 for 循环吗？

要不要我再详细讲讲？🌟


# the trick in self-attention: matrix multiply as weighted aggregation

is that we can be very very efficient about doing this using matrix multiplication so that's the
mathematical trick and let me show you what I mean let's work with the toy example here let me run it and I'll
explain I have a simple Matrix here that is a 3X3 of all ones a matrix B of just
random numbers and it's a 3x2 and a matrix C which will be 3x3 multip 3x2
which will give out a 3x2 so here we're just using um matrix multiplication so a
multiply B gives us C okay so how are these numbers in C um
achieved right so this number in the top left is the first row of a dot product
with the First Column of B and since all the the row of a right now is all just
ones then the do product here with with this column of B is just going to do a sum of these of this column so 2 + 6 + 6
is 14 the element here in the output of C is also the first column here the first
row of a multiplied now with the second column of B so 7 + 4 + 5 is 16 now you
see that there's repeating elements here so this 14 again is because this row is again all ones and it's multiplying the
First Column of B so we get 14 and this one is and so on so this last number
here is the last row do product last column now the trick here is uh the
following this is just a boring number of um it's just a boring array of all
ones but torch has this function called Trail which is short for a
triangular uh something like that and you can wrap it in torch up once and it will just return the lower triangular
portion of this okay so now it will basically zero out
uh these guys here so we just get the lower triangular part well what happens if we do
that so now we'll have a like this and B like this and now what are we getting here in C well what is this number well
this is the first row times the First Column and because this is zeros
uh these elements here are now ignored so we just get a two and then this number here is the first row times the
second column and because these are zeros they get ignored and it's just seven this seven multiplies this one but
look what happened here because this is one and then zeros we what ended up happening is we're just plucking out the
row of this row of B and that's what we got now here we have one 1 Z so here 110
do product with these two columns will now give us 2 + 6 which is 8 and 7 + 4 which is 11 and because this is 111 we
ended up with the addition of all of them and so basically depending on how many ones and zeros we have here we are
basically doing a sum currently of a variable number of these rows and that
gets deposited into C So currently we're doing sums because these are ones but we can also do
average right and you can start to see how we could do average uh of the rows of B uh sort of in an incremental
fashion because we don't have to we can basically normalize these rows so that they sum to one and then we're going to
get an average so if we took a and then we did aals aide torch. sum in the um of a in the um
oneth Dimension and then let's keep them as true so so therefore the broadcasting
will work out so if I rerun this you see now that these rows now sum to one so
this row is one this row is 0. 5.5 Z and here we get 1/3 and now when we do a
multiply B what are we getting here we are just getting the first row first row
here now we are getting the average of the first two rows okay so 2 and six average is four
and four and seven average is 5.5 and on the bottom here we are now getting the average of these three rows
so the average of all of elements of B are now deposited here and so you can
see that by manipulating these uh elements of this multiplying Matrix and
then multiplying it with any given Matrix we can do these averages in this
incremental fashion because we just get um and we can manipulate that based on
the elements of a okay so that's very convenient so let's let's swing back up here and see how we can vectorize this

当然可以，我来详细解释这一段的内容，这段非常关键，关系到 self-attention 的核心技巧：

---

### 📌 这一段讲什么？

👉 **self-attention 其实就是“加权求和”，而加权求和可以用矩阵乘法非常高效地实现**。
👉 这个例子是为了帮你理解，**矩阵乘法怎么就能做“累加、平均”这种操作？**

---

### 📌 小例子设置

```python
A = 3x3 矩阵，全是 1  
B = 3x2 矩阵，随机值  
C = A @ B → 结果是 3x2 矩阵
```

---

### 📌 普通矩阵乘法

```
C = A @ B
```

每个 C\[i,j] 是：

```
A[i,:]（第 i 行） 和 B[:,j]（第 j 列） 的点积
```

---

### 📌 为什么 C 里是“累加”的效果？

因为 A 的行是全 1：

```
[1,1,1]
```

点积就变成 “B 某一列的所有值求和”：

```
[2,6,6] → 和 = 14
[7,4,5] → 和 = 16
```

所以：

```
C[0,0] = 14
C[0,1] = 16
```

---

### 📌 改用下三角矩阵（tril）

```python
A = torch.tril(torch.ones(3,3))
```

意思是：

```
A = 下三角矩阵  
[[1,0,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]
```

---

### 📌 为什么要用 tril？

👉 因为：

* 语言模型不能看未来 token
* 只能聚合自己 + 之前的 token 信息

**下三角矩阵正好就实现了这种 mask，未来 token 权重=0**！

---

### 📌 矩阵乘法后效果

```
C = A @ B
```

* 第一行：只取 token1，直接复制到 C\[0,:]
* 第二行：前 2 个 token 求和 → 存到 C\[1,:]
* 第三行：前 3 个 token 求和 → 存到 C\[2,:]

---

### 📌 改成“平均”

可以用：

```python
A /= A.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)
```

* 把 A 每一行 normalize，行和=1
* 矩阵乘法就变成 “**加权平均**”

---

### 📌 小结这一 trick

👉 **矩阵乘法 A @ B 可以高效实现：**

* 前 t 个 token 累加
* 或者 前 t 个 token 平均
* A 的 tril + normalize 就能控制这种行为

---

### 📌 self-attention 的关系

Transformer 里的 self-attention 本质上是：

```
C = softmax(scores) @ V
```

* softmax(scores) → 就是一个 A 矩阵，表示 token 间的注意力（加权系数）
* V → 就是 token 的 embedding 矩阵
* 矩阵乘法 → 就是“按注意力加权求和”

---

### 📌 这段的核心思想

👉 “通过设计一个 mask（下三角矩阵 tril），再 normalize，配合矩阵乘法，就能高效实现 token 之间的加权求和（信息交流）。”

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 **self-attention 里的信息流动，其实就是矩阵乘法实现的“加权平均”，
而这个 toy 例子帮你先理解“为啥矩阵乘法就能做到”！**

---

如果你想，我可以继续补充讲讲：

✅ self-attention 中 softmax 是怎么起作用的？
✅ 为什么 mask 必须用 tril？
✅ 这个矩阵乘法和 for 循环相比有多快？

要不要我再帮你展开讲讲？🌟


# version 2: using matrix multiply

and make it much more efficient using what we've learned so in particular we are going to produce an
array a but here I'm going to call it we short for weights but this is our
a and this is how much of every row we want to average up and it's going to be
an average because you can see that these rows sum to one so this is our a and then our B in
this example of course is X so what's going to happen here now is
that we are going to have an expo 2 and this Expo 2 is going to be way
multiplying RX so let's think this true way is T BYT
and this is Matrix multiplying in pytorch a b by T by C and it's giving us uh different what
shape so pytorch will come here and it will see that these shapes are not the same so it will create a batch Dimension
here and this is a batched matrix multiply and so it will apply this matrix multiplication in all the batch
elements um in parallel and individually and then for each batch element there
will be a t BYT multiplying T by C exactly as we had
below so this will now create B by T by C and Expo 2 will now become identical
to Expo so we can see that torch. all close of
xbo and xbo 2 should be true now so this kind of like convinces us
that uh these are in fact um the same so xbo and xbo 2 if I just print
them uh okay we're not going to be able to okay we're not going to be able to just stare it down but
um well let me try Expo basically just at the zeroth element and Expo two at the zeroth element so just the first
batch and we should see that this and that should be identical which they are right so what happened here the
trick is we were able to use batched Matrix multiply to do this uh
aggregation really and it's a weighted aggregation and the weights are specified in this um T BYT array and
we're basically doing weighted sums and uh these weighted sums are are U according to uh the weights inside here
they take on sort of this triangular form and so that means that a token at the teth dimension will only get uh sort
of um information from the um tokens perceiving it so that's exactly what we
want and finally I would like to rewrite it in one more way and we're going to see why that's useful so this is the

当然可以！我来帮你详细解释一下 **“version 2: using matrix multiply”** 这一段的内容：

---

### 📌 这一段的核心思想

👉 刚才 “for 循环 + 均值” 的实现效率太低，
👉 其实可以用 **矩阵乘法（batched matmul）** 实现，速度会快很多，GPU 也能加速。

---

### 📌 变量对应关系

* **weights（w）** 就是之前说的矩阵 A，下三角矩阵 tril 归一化成“加权系数”。

  * shape = (T, T)
  * 每一行 sum = 1 → 就是做加权平均
* **B** 就是 x，本来 shape 是 (B, T, C)
* **expo2 = w @ x**
  → 这个就是我们想得到的 “历史信息平均特征”

---

### 📌 具体做法

#### 1️⃣ 定义 w (weights)

```python
w = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))  
w /= w.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True)
```

* 先用 tril 生成下三角矩阵
* 再对每一行归一化，使行和=1
  → 这样做出来的 w 其实就是 “平均历史信息”的系数矩阵

---

#### 2️⃣ 执行 batched 矩阵乘法

```python
expo2 = w @ x  # 实际用的是 batched matmul
```

但是这里直接这么写，pytorch 会自动进行广播：

* w 是 (T, T)
* x 是 (B, T, C)

Pytorch 发现 batch 维不匹配，会 **自动在 w 前面加 batch 维度**，做 batched matmul：

* 每个 batch 独立计算
* 相当于对每条序列做 `(T, T) @ (T, C)` → 得到 (T, C)

所以：

```
expo2.shape = (B, T, C)
```

---

### 📌 为什么结果和 for 循环版一样？

```python
torch.allclose(xbow, expo2)
```

这个语句在验证：
“for 循环实现的 `xbow` 和 矩阵乘法实现的 `expo2`，结果是不是一样的？”

* 结果是 True，说明两种实现 **数学上等价**。

---

### 📌 为什么这么做？

* 用 batched matmul：

  * 更快（特别在 GPU 上）
  * 写法更简洁
  * 没有 for 循环，效率高
* 本质思想：

  * 用一个 (T,T) 矩阵作为“注意力权重”
  * 乘到 (T,C) 的 embedding 矩阵
  * 得到新的 “信息聚合特征”

---

### 📌 和 self-attention 的关系？

👉 这其实就是 self-attention 的 “核心数学结构”：

```
attention_output = softmax(attention_scores) @ V
```

* softmax(attention\_scores) → 就像 w，下三角 + 归一化
* V → 就是 token embedding，shape (B, T, C)
* 最终就是：**矩阵乘法高效做“信息聚合”**

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 这段教你：

**“把 token 间的加权求和，用矩阵乘法 (batched matmul) 高效实现，和 for 循环版完全等价，但速度快很多。”**

---

如果你还想，我还可以继续补充：

✅ 这个 “矩阵乘法” 和 Transformer 里的 QK softmax 有什么关系？
✅ 为什么必须用下三角？
✅ batched matmul 是怎么实现并行的？

要不要我再帮你详细讲讲？🌟


# version 3: adding softmax

third version and it's also identical to the first and second but let me talk through it it uses
softmax so Trill here is this Matrix
lower triangular ones way begins as all
zero okay so if I just print way in the beginning it's all zero then I
used masked fill so what this is doing is we. masked fill it's all zeros and
I'm saying for all the elements where Trill is equal equal Z make them be
negative Infinity so all the elements where Trill is zero will become negative Infinity now so this is what we get and
then the final line here is softmax so if I take a softmax along
every single so dim is negative one so along every single row if I do softmax
what is that going to do well softmax is um is also like a
normalization operation right and so spoiler alert you get the exact same
Matrix let me bring back to softmax and recall that in softmax we're going to exponentiate every single one
of these and then we're going to divide by the sum and so if we exponentiate
every single element here we're going to get a one and here we're going to get uh basically zero 0 z0 Z everywhere else
and then when we normalize we just get one here we're going to get one one and then zeros and then softmax will again
divide and this will give us 5.5 and so on and so this is also the uh the same
way to produce uh this mask now the reason that this is a bit more interesting and the reason we're going
to end up using it in self attention is that these weights here
begin uh with zero and you can think of this as like an interaction strength or like an affinity so basically it's
telling us how much of each uh token from the past do we want to Aggregate
and average up and then this line is saying tokens from
the past cannot communicate by setting them to negative Infinity we're saying that we will not aggregate anything from
those tokens and so basically this then goes through softmax and through the weighted
and this is the aggregation through matrix multiplication and so what this is now is you can think of these as um these
zeros are currently just set by us to be zero but a quick preview is that these
affinities between the tokens are not going to be just constant at zero they're going to be data dependent these
tokens are going to start looking at each other and some tokens will find other tokens more or less interesting
and depending on what their values are they're going to find each other interesting to different amounts and I'm
going to call those affinities I think and then here we are saying the future cannot communicate with the past we're
we're going to clamp them and then when we normalize and sum we're going to aggregate uh sort of their values
depending on how interesting they find each other and so that's the preview for self attention and basically long story
short from this entire section is that you can do weighted aggregations of your past
Elements by having by using matrix multiplication of a lower triangular
fashion and then the elements here in the lower triangular part are telling you how much of each element uh fuses
into this position so we're going to use this trick now to develop the self attention block block so first let's get

当然可以，这段是非常关键的内容，咱们仔细讲一下 version 3：**adding softmax**，这是理解 self-attention 的重点步骤。

---

### 📌 这一段讲什么？

👉 刚才 version 2 用的是：

```
tril + 平均 = 矩阵乘法
```

👉 现在 version 3 引入了 **softmax**，
就更接近 Transformer 里的 **self-attention** 真正做法了。

---

### 📌 操作步骤拆解

---

#### 1️⃣ 定义 mask (Tril)

```python
tril = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))
```

生成下三角矩阵：

```
[[1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 1]]
```

→ 作用：防止 “看未来 token”，保证 “只能聚合自己和历史 token”。

---

#### 2️⃣ 定义 weights (way)

```python
way = torch.zeros(T, T)
```

先初始化为全 0，表示 **当前 token 对其他 token 的“注意力强度”**（affinity）。

---

#### 3️⃣ 做 masked\_fill

```python
way.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf'))
```

👉 把 **未来 token（tril=0）对应位置设成 -∞**：

```
[[0, -inf, -inf],
 [0,    0, -inf],
 [0,    0,    0]]
```

---

#### 4️⃣ softmax 归一化

```python
way = F.softmax(way, dim=-1)
```

👉 重点：

* softmax( -∞ ) → 0
* softmax( 0 ) → 1 / N

结果就是：

```
[[1, 0, 0],
 [0.5, 0.5, 0],
 [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]]
```

---

### 📌 为什么要 softmax？

* softmax 会自动 **归一化权重**，变成 **加权平均**。
* softmax 是可微分的，后面可以用网络 **学习注意力分数**！

---

### 📌 最重要的概念

```
这些 weights，不再是人为设定（tril + 平均），  
而是可以用模型自动学出 token 间的“兴趣程度”。
```

比如：

```
某个 token 可能对前面某些 token 更“关注”，对其他 token 不太关注。  
→ 权重就会偏高 / 偏低，softmax 自动归一化。
```

---

### 📌 为什么要加 softmax，而不是直接用 tril？

✅ softmax 归一化
✅ softmax 可微，可以训练
✅ softmax 输出的 “注意力分数” 更细腻
✅ softmax 是 self-attention 的标准做法

---

### 📌 self-attention 预告

* 在 Transformer 里，attention 权重不是全 1、不是固定 tril，
* 而是：

```
attention_scores = Q @ K^T / sqrt(d_k)
attention_weights = softmax(attention_scores + mask)
attention_output = attention_weights @ V
```

这个 **attention\_weights** 就和 version 3 的 `way` 是同一个东西！

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 这一段 version 3 教你：

**“self-attention 其实就是用 softmax 归一化后的下三角矩阵，乘 embedding，
实现 token 间的加权信息融合（aggregation）。”**

---

### 📌 为什么这一段很重要？

✅ 这是 **Transformer self-attention 的数学核心**
✅ 你理解了这个，马上就能理解 Transformer 的 Q、K、V 计算
✅ 这就是 Transformer 比 RNN / Bigram 强大的地方：可以学出“兴趣关系”！

---

如果你还想，我还可以补充讲：

✅ softmax 为什么选择 dim=-1？
✅ self-attention 里的 QK^T 怎么来？
✅ 为什么叫“加权求和”而不是“卷积”？

要不要我再帮你详细讲讲？🌟


wei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1) 中的 dim=-1 是什么意思

这个问题问得特别好！我来详细解释：

---

### 📌 先看语句

```python
wei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)
```

---

### 📌 什么是 `dim=-1` ？

`dim` 参数的意思是：

👉 **在哪一维上做 softmax 运算**。

### 📌 为什么叫 `-1` ？

* 在 PyTorch 里，**维度可以用正数或负数表示**：

  * 0 表示第 0 维（最外层）
  * 1 表示第 1 维
  * 2 表示第 2 维
  * ...
  * **-1 表示最后一维**

也就是说：

```
dim = -1 <==> dim = wei.ndim - 1
```

---

### 📌 为什么要在最后一维做 softmax？

在这里，`wei` 的 shape 是 `(T, T)`，也就是：

```
行 → 当前 token（t）  
列 → 对其他 token 的注意力权重
```

→ 每一行表示：

**“当前 token 对其他 token 的注意力权重分布”**

---

我们希望：

```
softmax 每一行，归一化成 1  
→ 每行 sum = 1，变成“概率分布”
```

---

所以要：

```python
F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)
```

* dim=-1 → 对“每一行”的元素做 softmax
* 结果就是：

  * 每一行 sum=1
  * 每一行是“当前 token 对其他 token 的加权系数”

---

### 📌 举例

假设：

```python
wei = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6]])
```

* shape = (2, 3)

如果写：

```python
F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)
```

效果是：

* 对 **每一行** `[1,2,3]`、`[4,5,6]` 各自做 softmax
* 归一化成：

```
[[softmax(1,2,3)],  
 [softmax(4,5,6)]]
```

---

### 📌 为什么不用 dim=0？

如果你写：

```python
F.softmax(wei, dim=0)
```

那就会对 “每一列” 做 softmax，逻辑就错了。
因为我们希望 **“每个 token 的注意力分布”** 是一行，归一化一行。

---

### 📌 总结一句话

```python
dim=-1
```

👉 就是“对最后一维做 softmax”
👉 在 (T,T) 里，就是 **按行做 softmax**，
👉 得到 “当前 token 对其他 token 的注意力分布”！

---

如果你还想，我还可以补充讲：

✅ 为什么 softmax 行 sum=1 很关键？
✅ 如果是 (B, T, T)，dim=-1 会怎样？
✅ softmax 为什么选在 attention 用？

要不要我继续帮你讲？🌟


# minor code cleanup

some quick preliminaries out of the way first the thing I'm kind of bothered by is that you see how we're passing in
vocap size into the Constructor there's no need to do that because vocap size is already defined uh up top as a global
variable so there's no need to pass this stuff around next what I want to do is I don't
want to actually create I want to create like a level of indirection here where we don't directly go to the embedding
for the um logits but instead we go through this intermediate phase because we're going to start making that bigger
so let me introduce a new variable n embed it shorted for number of embedding
Dimensions so nbed here will be say 32 that was a
suggestion from GitHub co-pilot by the way um it also suest 32 which is a good number so this is an embedding table and
only 32 dimensional embeddings so then here this is not going to give us logits directly instead
this is going to give us token embeddings that's I'm going to call it and then to go from the token Tings to
the logits we're going to need a linear layer so self. LM head let's call it
short for language modeling head is n and linear from n ined up to vocap size
and then when we swing over here we're actually going to get the loits by exactly what the co-pilot says now we
have to be careful here because this C and this C are not equal um this is nmed
C and this is vocap size so let's just say that n ined is equal to
C and then this just creates one spous layer of interaction through a linear layer but uh this should basically
run so we see that this runs and uh this currently looks kind of spous but uh
we're going to build on top of this now next up so far we've taken these indices

当然可以！我来帮你详细解释这一段 **minor code cleanup** 做了什么调整，为什么要改：

---

### 📌 这一段主要讲什么？

👉 **小幅度代码清理 + 做一些准备工作**，
👉 为了后面实现更复杂的模型（self-attention、Transformer block）打基础。

---

### 📌 主要做了哪些修改？

---

#### 1️⃣ 不再手动传 vocap\_size

原来：

```python
class BigramLanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size):
```

但是：

```python
vocab_size 其实是全局变量，没必要重复传
```

---

#### 2️⃣ 新增 n\_embed 参数

```python
n_embed = 32  # embedding 维度
```

* 之前 embedding 表是 `(vocab_size, vocab_size)`，
  → 非常 “宽”，没必要，浪费参数
* 现在改成：

```python
nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_embed)
```

* 意思是：
  每个 token 不再用 vocab\_size 维表示，
  → 改成 n\_embed 维，**更紧凑**

* 32 是一个经验值，适合 tiny Shakespeare 这种小数据集。

---

#### 3️⃣ 新增 “一层 Linear 层” 做 logits 映射

原来：

```python
embedding → 直接输出 logits
```

改成：

```python
embedding → Linear 层 → logits
```

* 新增一层：

```python
self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_embed, vocab_size)
```

* 作用：
  把 embedding 空间映射回 logits 空间，
  logits 维度 = vocab\_size

---

#### 4️⃣ 为什么这样改？

**核心原因**：

👉 以前的 bigram 模型 “直接查 embedding 表 → logits”
👉 但是 self-attention/Transformer 是多层叠加的网络，**embedding → Transformer 层 → head → logits**
👉 现在提前改好结构，**拆出 embedding 和 head**，为后续加复杂层打基础。

---

### 📌 结果

改完之后，forward 流程变成：

```text
idx (B,T) → embedding (B,T,n_embed) → Linear 层 → logits (B,T,vocab_size)
```

---

### 📌 这个改法好在哪里？

✅ 以后 embedding 维度可以调大/小
✅ 以后可以插入 self-attention、FFN 层
✅ 整个模型结构更接近 GPT 风格
✅ 代码更通用

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 这一段其实是在 **把 bigram 模型结构升级成 Transformer-ready 结构**，
👉 embedding → Linear → logits，
👉 为后面加 self-attention 做准备。

---

如果你还想，我可以继续补充讲讲：

✅ 为什么 embedding\_dim 不需要等于 vocab\_size？
✅ 这个 Linear 层和 Transformer 最后一层 head 有什么关系？
✅ 为什么 GPT2 也用 embedding + lm\_head 结构？

要不要我再帮你详细讲讲？🌟


# positional encoding

and we've encoded them based on the identity of the uh tokens in inside idx
the next thing that people very often do is that we're not just encoding the identity of these tokens but also their
position so we're going to have a second position uh embedding table here so self. position embedding table is an an
embedding of block size by an embed and so each position from zero to block size minus one will also get its own
embedding vector and then here first let me decode B BYT from idx do
shape and then here we're also going to have a pause embedding which is the positional embedding and these are this
is to arrange so this will be basically just integers from Z to T minus one and
all of those integers from 0 to T minus one get embedded through the table to create a t by
C and then here this gets renamed to just say x and x will be the addition of
the token embeddings with the positional embeddings and here the broadcasting note will work out so B by T by C plus T
by C this gets right aligned a new dimension of one gets added and it gets broadcasted across
batch so at this point x holds not just the token identities but the positions
at which these tokens occur and this is currently not that useful because of course we just have a simple byr model
so it doesn't matter if you're in the fifth position the second position or wherever it's all translation invariant at this stage uh so this information
currently wouldn't help uh but as we work on the self attention block we'll see that this starts to matter
okay so now we get the Crux of self attention so this is probably the most important part of this video to

当然可以，这一段讲的其实是 **“为什么要加 positional encoding，怎么加 positional embedding”**，我来详细解释一下：

---

### 📌 之前模型里，tokens 是怎么编码的？

* 原来我们是：

```text
idx → token_embedding_table → 得到 token embedding
```

* 也就是说，**每个 token 是通过 token id → 查表 → 得到 embedding 向量**，
* 这个 embedding 只编码了 **token 是什么字/词**，
* 但是 **“它在句子里的位置”** 没有编码进去！

---

### 📌 为什么要加 positional encoding？

👉 因为：

* Transformer 是 “全并行” 计算的，它 **不关心 token 顺序**。
* 如果不给模型额外信息，它“看不出”这个 token 是第1个、第2个、第5个……

**而语言模型是“有顺序”的任务**：

* "I love you" 和 "You love I" 是不一样的句子。

👉 所以需要 **告诉模型：每个 token 处在哪个位置**。

---

### 📌 怎么加 positional embedding？

```python
self.position_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(block_size, n_embed)
```

* 新增一个 **position embedding 表**，shape 是：

```
(block_size, n_embed)
```

也就是说：

* 位置 0 → 一个 n\_embed 维向量
* 位置 1 → 一个 n\_embed 维向量
* ...
* 位置 block\_size-1 → 一个 n\_embed 维向量

---

### 📌 怎么取出 position embedding？

```python
pos_emb = self.position_embedding_table(torch.arange(T))
```

* `T` 是当前序列长度
* 生成 0 \~ T-1 的整数序列 → 每个位置一个 id
* 喂进 position\_embedding\_table，得到：

```
(T, n_embed)  → 每个位置的 embedding
```

---

### 📌 怎么加到 token embedding 上？

```python
x = tok_emb + pos_emb  # broadcasting 自动处理
```

* tok\_emb 是：

```
(B, T, n_embed)
```

* pos\_emb 是：

```
(T, n_embed)
```

* **通过 broadcasting**，pos\_emb 会自动扩展到：

```
(B, T, n_embed)
```

* 然后 **逐元素相加**：

```
x[b, t, :] = tok_emb[b, t, :] + pos_emb[t, :]
```

---

### 📌 加 positional embedding 有什么用？

✅ 让模型知道 “当前 token 在句子中的位置”
✅ Transformer 本身是 permutation-invariant（无序的），需要 positional embedding 才能建模顺序

---

### 📌 为什么 bigram 模型暂时还没用上？

👉 现在模型还是 bigram 模型 → 只看当前 token，不看上下文
👉 **位置信息暂时没用**（看不出效果）

✅ 但是 **马上要加 self-attention**，self-attention 是全局看的 → 位置就很重要了！
✅ 所以提前加好 position embedding，准备后面用！

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 这一段讲的是：

**“加 positional embedding，告诉模型 token 在句子里的位置，
这样 Transformer 才能建模顺序！”**

---

如果你还想，我还可以帮你讲讲：

✅ positional encoding 和 positional embedding 有什么区别？
✅ 为什么用 nn.Embedding 而不是固定的 sin/cos？
✅ GPT/Transformer 里实际是怎么加的？

要不要我帮你详细讲一讲？🌟


# THE CRUX OF THE VIDEO: version 4: self-attention

understand we're going to implement a small self attention for a single individual head as they're called so we
start off with where we were so all of this code is familiar so right now I'm
working with an example where I Chang the number of channels from 2 to 32 so we have a 4x8 arrangement of tokens and
each to and the information each token is currently 32 dimensional but we just are working with random
numbers now we saw here that the code as we had it before does a uh simple weight
simple average of all the past tokens and the current token so it's just the
previous information and current information is just being mixed together in an average and that's what this code currently achieves and it Doo by
creating this lower triangular structure which allows us to mask out this uh we
uh Matrix that we create so we mask it out and then we normalize it and
currently when we initialize the affinities between all the different sort of tokens or nodes I'm going to use
those terms interchangeably so when we initialize the affinities between all the different tokens to be zero then we see that way
gives us this um structure where every single row has these um uniform numbers
and so that's what that's what then uh in this Matrix multiply makes it so that we're doing a simple
average now we don't actually want this to be all uniform because different uh
tokens will find different other tokens more or less interesting and we want that to be data dependent so for example
if I'm a vowel then maybe I'm looking for consonants in my past and maybe I want to know what those consonants are
and I want that information to flow to me and so I want to now gather information from the past but I want to
do it in the data dependent way and this is the problem that self attention solves now the way self attention solves
this is the following every single node or every single token at each position
will emit two vectors it will emit a query and it will emit a
key now the query Vector roughly speaking is what am I looking for and
the key Vector roughly speaking is what do I contain and then the way we get
affinities between these uh tokens now in a sequence is we basically just do a
do product between the keys and the queries so my query dot products with
all the keys of all the other tokens and that dot product now becomes
wayy and so um if the key and the query are sort of aligned they will interact
to a very high amount and then I will get to learn more about that specific token as opposed to any other token in
the sequence so let's implement this
now we're going to implement a single what's called head of self
attention so this is just one head there's a hyper parameter involved with these heads which is the head size and
then here I'm initializing linear modules and I'm using bias equals false so these are just going to apply a
matrix multiply with some fixed weights and now let me produce a key and
q k and Q by forwarding these modules on X so the size of this will now
become B by T by 16 because that is the head size and the same here B by T by
16 so this being the head size so you see here that when I forward this linear
on top of my X all the tokens in all the positions in the B BYT Arrangement all
of them them in parallel and independently produce a key and a query so no communication has happened
yet but the communication comes now all the queries will do product with all the
keys so basically what we want is we want way now or the affinities between these to be query multiplying key but we
have to be careful with uh we can't Matrix multiply this we actually need to transpose uh K but we have to be also
careful because these are when you have The Bash Dimension so in particular we want to transpose uh the last two
dimensions dimension1 and dimension -2 so
-21 and so this Matrix multiply now will basically do the following B by T by
16 Matrix multiplies B by 16 by T to give us B by T by
T right so for every row of B we're now going to
have a t Square Matrix giving us the affinities and these are now the way so
they're not zeros they are now coming from this dot product between the keys and the queries so this can now run I
can I can run this and the weighted aggregation now is a function in a data
Bandon manner between the keys and queries of these nodes so just inspecting what happened
here the way takes on this form and you see that before way was uh just
a constant so it was applied in the same way to all the batch elements but now every single batch elements will have
different sort of we because uh every single batch element contains different uh tokens at different positions and so
this is not data dependent so when we look at just the zeroth uh Row for
example in the input these are the weights that came out and so you can see now that they're not just exactly
uniform um and in particular as an example here for the last row this was the eighth token and the eighth token
knows what content it has and it knows at what position it's in and now the E token based on that uh creates a query
hey I'm looking for this kind of stuff um I'm a vowel I'm on the E position I'm looking for any consonant at positions
up to four and then all the nodes get to emit keys and maybe one of the channels
could be I am a I am a consonant and I am in a position up to four and that that key would have a high number in
that specific Channel and that's how the query and the key when they do product they can find each other and create a
high affinity and when they have a high Affinity like say uh this token was
pretty interesting to uh to this eighth token when they have a high Affinity
then through the softmax I will end up aggregating a lot of its information into my position and so I'll get to
learn a lot about it now just this we're looking at way
after this has already happened um let me erase this operation as well so let
me erase the masking and the softmax just to show you the under the hood internals and how that works so without
the masking in the softmax Whey comes out like this right this is the outputs of the do products um and these are the
raw outputs and they take on values from negative you know two to positive two Etc so that's the raw interactions and
raw affinities between all the nodes but now if I'm going if I'm a fifth node I will not want to aggregate anything from
the sixth node seventh node and the eighth node so actually we use the upper triangular masking so those are not
allowed to communicate and now we actually want to have a nice uh distribution uh so we
don't want to aggregate negative .11 of this node that's crazy so instead we exponentiate and normalize and now we
get a nice distribution that sums to one and this is telling us now in the data dependent manner how much of information
to aggregate from any of these tokens in the past so that's way and it's not zeros
anymore but but it's calculated in this way now there's one more uh part to a
single self attention head and that is that when we do the aggregation we don't actually aggregate the tokens exactly we
aggregate we produce one more value here and we call that the
value so in the same way that we produced p and query we're also going to create a value
and then here we don't aggregate X we calculate a v which is
just achieved by uh propagating this linear on top of X again and then we
output way multiplied by V so V is the elements that we aggregate or the the
vectors that we aggregate instead of the raw X and now of course uh this will make it
so that the output here of this single head will be 16 dimensional because that is the head
size so you can think of X as kind of like private information to this token if you if you think about it that way so
X is kind of private to this token so I'm a fifth token at some and I have some identity and uh my information is
kept in Vector X and now for the purposes of the single head here's what I'm interested in here's what I have and
if you find me interesting here's what I will communicate to you and that's stored in v and so V is the thing that
gets aggregated for the purposes of this single head between the different notes and that's uh basically the self
attention mechanism this is this is what it does there are a few notes that I would make like to make about attention

当然可以，这段是整段视频的**核心**（CRUX），讲解了 **Self-Attention 的本质逻辑**，我帮你详细解释：

---

### 📌 之前版本做了什么？

之前 version 1/2/3：

👉 每个 token 通过 **简单平均/加权平均** 聚合前面的 token 信息，
👉 但是 **加权系数是固定的**，没法根据 token 内容动态调整。

---

### 📌 Self-Attention 要解决什么问题？

**想要做到：**

✅ 每个 token 能“主动”决定对哪些前面 token 更感兴趣，
✅ 每次处理不同的输入（不同 token 内容）时，权重要**动态变化**，
✅ 不同 token 内容 → 不同 attention 权重，体现“理解”上下文。

---

### 📌 Self-Attention 怎么实现这个目标？

核心思想：

👉 每个 token 生成两个向量：

1️⃣ **Query（查询）向量** —— 我在“找”什么
2️⃣ **Key（键）向量** —— 我“是什么”

---

### 📌 怎么用 Query 和 Key 计算“兴趣程度”？

👉 每个 token 的 query 向量，和 **所有 token 的 key 向量** 做**点积**，
👉 得到一堆 **“兴趣程度（affinity）”**，形成 attention 权重矩阵。

举例：

```
token5.query ⨀ token1.key  
token5.query ⨀ token2.key  
token5.query ⨀ token3.key  
...  
token5.query ⨀ token5.key
```

这样 token5 知道：
我“多大程度上”要关注历史 token1、2、3、4、5……

---

### 📌 为什么加 Mask？

语言模型是**自回归**的，token5 不能看未来（token6,7,8），
所以用 **tril mask** 把未来 token 的权重置成 -inf，softmax 后 → 0。

---

### 📌 为什么要 softmax？

点积结果有正有负，scale 不一，
softmax 归一化为概率，保证：

✅ 权重 sum=1
✅ 不会出现“负关注”
✅ 便于训练优化

---

### 📌 还需要 Value（V）？

✅ 需要！

👉 每个 token 还生成一个 **Value 向量**，
👉 最后不是聚合 X，而是聚合 V！

逻辑是：

```
query ⨀ key → 得到 attention 权重  
attention 权重 ⨀ value → 得到新的 token 表示
```

---

### 📌 为什么要 V？

因为 X 是 token 的**私有信息**，
V 是 token 准备“分享”出去的信息，
不同 head、不同 query 关注不同 V，可以有不同的“看法”。

---

### 📌 计算流程总结

1️⃣ X → Linear → 得到 Q、K、V

```
Q = Linear_Q(X)  
K = Linear_K(X)  
V = Linear_V(X)
```

2️⃣ 计算 attention 权重：

```
wei = Q @ K^T / sqrt(head_size)  
wei = masked_fill(未来 token = -inf)  
wei = softmax(wei, dim=-1)
```

3️⃣ 加权聚合 Value：

```
out = wei @ V
```

---

### 📌 为什么叫 Head？

✅ 这个只是一个 Head，
✅ GPT、Transformer 里会有 **多个 head**，并行做 attention，学习不同关注模式。

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 Self-Attention 的本质：

**“每个 token 用 Q 向量决定对其他 token K 向量的兴趣程度，
根据兴趣程度加权聚合其他 token 的 V 向量，得到新的 token 表示。”**

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你详细补充：

✅ 为什么 QK 要除以 sqrt(dk)？
✅ 为什么要用多头 attention？
✅ 最后怎么拼接多头？
✅ Transformer 里完整 Self-Attention 是什么样子？

要不要我再帮你讲讲？🌟


key = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
query = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
value = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)

为什么key query value用 nn.Linear 来表示


你问得非常好！我来详细解释一下：

---

### 📌 这三句话在做什么？

```python
key   = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
query = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
value = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
```

意思是：

* 把原始的 token embedding（32 维）**映射成 head\_size 维（这里是 16 维）**
* 每个 token 通过一个 nn.Linear 层生成：

| 名字    | 含义                   | 用途           |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| key   | 这个 token “是什么”       | 供其他 token 参考 |
| query | 这个 token “我想找什么”     | 去查询其他 token  |
| value | 这个 token “我准备分享什么信息” | 供其他 token 聚合 |

---

### 📌 为什么用 nn.Linear 实现？

👉 本质上：Q、K、V 是 token embedding（x）的 **不同“投影”方向**，
👉 就是用 **不同参数矩阵** 做线性变换，学出“在不同语义空间下的表示”。

---

### 📌 更形象的解释

你可以把 Q、K、V 想成：

```
query = W_q * x  
key   = W_k * x  
value = W_v * x
```

其中：

* W\_q、W\_k、W\_v 是参数矩阵，学习出来的
* 作用：把 x（token embedding）映射到 3 个不同的空间

---

### 📌 为什么是 nn.Linear？

`nn.Linear(C, head_size)` 就相当于实现：

```python
output = x @ W.T
```

* 也就是 **矩阵乘法 + 可学习参数 W**
* W 会在训练过程中学出“什么 query、什么 key、什么 value 是有效的”

---

### 📌 为什么需要 3 个不同的 Linear？

因为：

* Q 是“要去查什么”
* K 是“我是什么”
* V 是“我要分享什么”

每个作用不同，语义空间不同，所以需要 **独立的 Linear 层，各自有参数 W**。

---

### 📌 总结一句话

👉 用 `nn.Linear` 是为了：

✅ 把原始 token embedding 投影成 **Q/K/V 3 个空间**
✅ 参数可学习，模型可以根据数据自己决定什么是“有用的信息”
✅ 是 Transformer 论文里的标准做法

---

如果你还想，我还可以补充讲：

✅ 为什么可以多个 head？
✅ 为什么 head\_size 可以比 C 小？
✅ 为什么 V 不直接用 X？

要不要我继续详细讲讲？🌟

```python
# version 4: self-attention!
torch.manual_seed(1337)
B,T,C = 4,8,32 # batch, time, channels
x = torch.randn(B,T,C)

# let's see a single Head perform self-attention
head_size = 16
key = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
query = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
value = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
k = key(x)   # (B, T, 16)
q = query(x) # (B, T, 16)
wei =  q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) # (B, T, 16) @ (B, 16, T) ---> (B, T, T)

tril = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))
#wei = torch.zeros((T,T))
wei = wei.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf'))
wei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)

v = value(x)
out = wei @ v

解释一下
```

当然可以！这段代码是 **version 4: self-attention!** 的 PyTorch 代码实现，
我来一步步帮你详细讲解：

---

### 📌 整体目标

👉 用 Q、K、V 和矩阵乘法，**实现一个单头 self-attention**，
👉 得到新的 token 表示 `out`。

---

### 📌 代码详细拆解

---

#### 1️⃣ 初始化输入数据

```python
torch.manual_seed(1337)
B, T, C = 4, 8, 32
x = torch.randn(B, T, C)
```

* B = 4 → batch size
* T = 8 → 每条序列 8 个 token
* C = 32 → 每个 token 是 32 维向量

x shape：

```
(B, T, C) = (4, 8, 32)
```

---

#### 2️⃣ 定义 Q, K, V 的 Linear 层

```python
head_size = 16
key   = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
query = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
value = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)
```

每个 token 通过 Linear 映射成：

* Q (query) 向量
* K (key) 向量
* V (value) 向量

维度：

```
(B, T, 16)
```

---

#### 3️⃣ 计算 Q 和 K

```python
k = key(x)   # (B, T, 16)
q = query(x) # (B, T, 16)
```

* 对 batch 里的每个 token，**独立计算 Q 和 K 向量**
* 不同 token 得到不同的 Q/K，表明它们“是谁”“想找什么”

---

#### 4️⃣ 计算 Attention 权重

```python
wei = q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)  # (B, T, 16) @ (B, 16, T) ---> (B, T, T)
```

👉 计算：

```
q_i ⋅ k_j  → 表示 token_i 对 token_j 的兴趣程度
```

结果是：

```
wei.shape = (B, T, T)
```

意思是：

```
wei[b, i, j] = batch b 里，第 i 个 token 对 第 j 个 token 的兴趣
```

---

#### 5️⃣ mask 掉未来 token

```python
tril = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))
wei = wei.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf'))
```

👉 语言模型是 **自回归**，只能看“过去+现在”，不能看“未来”。

* 用 tril (下三角矩阵) 做 mask，
* 把“未来 token” 权重置成 `-inf`，
* softmax 后 → 权重 = 0

---

#### 6️⃣ softmax 归一化

```python
wei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)
```

👉 softmax 对 **每行** 归一化成概率分布 (sum=1)：

```
wei[b, i, :] = 第 i 个 token 对历史 token 的加权系数
```

---

#### 7️⃣ 计算 V

```python
v = value(x)  # (B, T, 16)
```

👉 每个 token 生成 **自己要分享的 value 信息**。

---

#### 8️⃣ 聚合 V，得到新 token 表示

```python
out = wei @ v
```

shape：

```
(B, T, T) @ (B, T, 16) → (B, T, 16)
```

👉 每个 token：

* 对历史 token 的 V 做加权平均，
* 得到 **更新后的 token 表示 out**。

---

### 📌 整体流程总结

```
x → Q, K, V  
Q @ K^T → attention scores  
mask + softmax → attention weights  
attention weights @ V → out (新 token 表示)
```

---

### 📌 这一段的意义

👉 这段代码就是 **单个 self-attention head 的核心实现**，
👉 跟 Transformer 论文里的 attention 数学完全一致！

---

### 📌 最终输出 out

```
out.shape = (B, T, head_size)
```

每个 token 有了 **带上下文感知** 的新表示 out。

# note 1: attention as communication

number one attention is a communication mechanism you can really think about it as a communication mechanism where you
have a number of nodes in a directed graph where basically you have edges pointed between noes like
this and what happens is every node has some Vector of information and it gets to aggregate information via a weighted
sum from all of the nodes that point to it and this is done in a data dependent manner so depending on whatever data is
actually stored that you should not at any point in time now our graph doesn't
look like this our graph has a different structure we have eight nodes because the block size is eight and there's
always eight to tokens and uh the first node is only pointed to by itself the second node is
pointed to by the first node and itself all the way up to the eighth node which is pointed to by all the previous nodes
and itself and so that's the structure that our directed graph has or happens happens to have in Auto regressive sort
of scenario like language modeling but in principle attention can be applied to any arbitrary directed graph and it's
just a communication mechanism between the nodes the second note is that notice that there is no notion of space so

当然可以，这一段讲的是 **“注意力机制本质上是一种通信机制”**，我来帮你详细解释：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ 注意力是通信机制（attention as communication）

* 你可以把 **Self-Attention** 想象成：

👉 一张 **有向图（directed graph）**
👉 图中有若干个 “节点（node）”，每个节点 = 一个 token

---

### 📌 2️⃣ 节点之间怎么通信？

* 每个节点有自己的 “信息向量”（比如 embedding 向量）

* 节点之间通过 “有向边” 传递信息，**边有权重（weight）**

* 某个节点收到的信息是：

```
来自所有指向它的节点，信息的加权和（weighted sum）
```

* 这个 “加权” 是 **根据数据内容动态算出来的**
  （由 QK 点积 + softmax 计算出）

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 我们的语言模型（自回归）里图长什么样？

* 假设 block size = 8，sequence 长度是 8：

```
token 1：只能看自己  
token 2：可以看 token 1 + 自己  
token 3：可以看 token 1,2 + 自己  
...  
token 8：可以看 token 1~7 + 自己
```

* 也就是说，图里边的 “箭头” 只指向 “之前 + 当前” token
* **不能看未来 token**，这是语言模型的自回归特性。

---

### 📌 4️⃣ 通信是 “数据相关” 的

* 每条边的权重 **不是固定的**，而是 **根据 Q、K 向量算出来的**
* 数据不同 → 权重不同 → 通信强弱不同

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 不局限于语言模型

* 虽然在语言模型里，图结构是：

```
token 1 → token 1  
token 2 → token 1,2  
token 3 → token 1,2,3  
...  
```

* 但其实 **注意力机制可以用在任何图**
* 也可以用在图神经网络（Graph Neural Network, GNN）
* 可以实现任意图中的 “信息传递”

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 总结一句话

👉 Self-Attention 本质是：

**“节点之间根据数据动态计算权重，进行信息传递（通信）”**

* token = 节点
* QK 点积 → 算 “谁对谁有兴趣”
* softmax → 算 “通信强度”
* V → 传递出去的信息
* weighted sum → 收到的信息

---

如果你还想，我可以接着帮你讲：

✅ 为什么 attention 不需要“空间坐标”？
✅ 为什么这种“通信”机制这么强大？
✅ 这和 Transformer 为什么这么有效有啥关系？

要不要我继续帮你展开讲？🌟


# note 2: attention has no notion of space, operates over sets

attention simply acts over like a set of vectors in this graph and so by default
these nodes have no idea where they are positioned in the space and that's why we need to encode them positionally and
sort of give them some information that is anchored to a specific position so that they sort of know where they are
and this is different than for example from convolution because if you're run for example a convolution operation over some input there's a very specific sort
of layout of the information in space and the convolutional filters sort of act in space and so it's it's not like
an attention in ATT ention is just a set of vectors out there in space they communicate and if you want them to have
a notion of space you need to specifically add it which is what we've done when we calculated the um relative
the positional encode encodings and added that information to the vectors the next thing that I hope is very clear

当然可以！这一段讲的是 **Self-Attention 和空间信息的关系**，我来帮你详细解释：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ Attention 本质上没有空间概念

* **Attention 操作的是“一组向量”**（set of vectors）
* 这些向量之间的计算（QK 点积）**只跟向量本身的内容有关**
* 它们 **默认不知道自己在“序列里”是第几个 token**

---

### 📌 2️⃣ 为什么要加 Positional Encoding？

* 语言是有顺序的（I love you ≠ You love I）
* 但 Attention 默认 **不区分顺序**，只看到一堆 token 向量

所以我们要 **手动加 Positional Encoding**：

```
token_embedding + positional_embedding
```

* 这样 token 才知道自己是 “第 3 个” 还是 “第 5 个”

---

### 📌 3️⃣ Attention 和卷积（Convolution）的区别

👉 卷积（Conv）天然有“空间”概念：

* 卷积核是滑动窗口
* 卷积核知道“我在图片（或序列）里的位置”
* 位置决定了卷积核感知的信息

👉 Attention：

* 完全是对“向量集合”做操作
* 没有“滑动”概念
* 没有固定的空间顺序
* 必须**手动加位置编码**，它才知道“自己在哪”

---

### 📌 4️⃣ 总结一句话

**Self-Attention 本质对一组向量操作，**
**默认没有空间/位置信息，**
**需要显式加 Positional Encoding 才能建模“顺序”或“空间”。**

✅ Positional Encoding 有几种常用方式？
✅ 为什么 Transformer 用“加法”而不是拼接？
✅ CNN 和 Attention 在处理空间信息时有啥优缺点？

# note 3: there is no communication across batch dimension

is that the elements across the batch Dimension which are independent examples never talk to each other they're always
processed independently and this is a batched matrix multiply that applies basically a matrix multiplication uh
kind of in parallel across the batch dimension so maybe it would be more accurate to say that in this analogy of
a directed graph we really have because the back size is four we really have four separate pools of eight nodes and
those eight nodes only talk to each other but in total there's like 32 nodes that are being processed uh but there's
um sort of four separate pools of eight you can look at it that way the next note is that here in the case of

当然可以！这一段在讲 **batch 维度（batch dimension）和 attention 的关系**，我来帮你解释一下 👇：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ batch 维度里的例子是“独立的”

* 在神经网络训练时，通常我们用 **batch 训练**：

```
batch_size = 4
```

* 意思是 **每次输入 4 个样本（序列）**，一起训练，效率更高。

---

### 📌 2️⃣ Self-Attention 里，batch 之间互不影响

* 注意力机制 **不会跨 batch 通信**：

```
batch 0 的 token 们  
batch 1 的 token 们  
batch 2 的 token 们  
batch 3 的 token 们
```

* 彼此之间 **完全独立**，它们的 Q/K/V 计算，softmax 计算，
  全部只在各自 batch 内部进行。

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 矩阵乘法怎么做？

```
wei = q @ k.T  # 这里是 batched matrix multiply
```

意思是：

* PyTorch 会对 **batch 里的每一条序列**
* 分别做 attention 计算，**并行执行**，但互不影响

---

### 📌 4️⃣ 图的类比

讲者打了个比方：

* 这里 **batch\_size=4**，**block\_size=8**：

就像 **4 个独立的小图**，每个小图里有 8 个节点：

```
图1：8个token  
图2：8个token  
图3：8个token  
图4：8个token
```

→ 每个图内部 token 之间有 attention，
→ 不同图之间完全没有通信。

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 总结一句话

**batch 维度里的序列是独立计算 attention 的，**
**batch 只是为了并行计算加速，互不通信。**

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你讲：

✅ 为什么 batch 设计成这样？
✅ 怎么理解 batched matrix multiply？
✅ 有没有场景需要跨 batch attention？

# note 4: encoder blocks vs. decoder blocks

language modeling uh we have this specific uh structure of directed graph where the future tokens will not
communicate to the Past tokens but this doesn't necessarily have to be the constraint in the general case and in
fact in many cases you may want to have all of the uh noes talk to each other uh fully so as an example if you're doing
sentiment analysis or something like that with a Transformer you might have a number of tokens and you may want to
have them all talk to each other fully because later you are predicting for example the sentiment of the sentence
and so it's okay for these NOS to talk to each other and so in those cases you will use an encoder block of self
attention and uh all it means that it's an encoder block is that you will delete this line of code allowing all the noes
to completely talk to each other what we're implementing here is sometimes called a decoder block and it's called a
decoder because it is sort of like a decoding language and it's got this
autor regressive format where you have to mask with the Triangular Matrix so that uh nodes from the future never talk
to the Past because they would give away the answer and so basically in encoder blocks you
would delete this allow all the noes to talk in decoder blocks this will always be present so that you have this
triangular structure uh but both are allowed and attention doesn't care attention supports arbitrary connectivity between nodes the next

当然可以！这一段在讲 **encoder block 和 decoder block 的区别**，我来帮你详细解释 👇：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ Language Model 里的图结构是“单向的”

* 在语言模型（Language Modeling）任务里：

```
token 1 → token 1  
token 2 → token 1,2  
token 3 → token 1,2,3  
...
```

👉 未来 token **不能看到未来**
👉 只能看到“过去 + 当前”

* 因为是 **自回归（autoregressive）**，一步步生成，不允许作弊。

---

### 📌 2️⃣ mask 就是实现“未来不能看”

```python
wei = wei.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf'))
```

这个 tril 三角 mask 保证：

```
token_i 只看 <= i 的 token  
不会看到 i+1 以后
```

---

### 📌 3️⃣ Decoder Block 是什么？

👉 这种加了 mask 的 block，叫：

```
Decoder Block
```

原因：

* 它“解码语言”，一步步预测 token，必须阻止未来信息泄露。

---

### 📌 4️⃣ Encoder Block 是什么？

如果做的是：

✅ 情感分析
✅ 文本分类
✅ 机器翻译编码阶段
✅ 图像处理

👉 通常希望 **所有 token 互相都能看**，
👉 就不用加 mask，直接让 token 之间全连接：

```
wei = q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)
# 不需要 masked_fill
```

→ 这种叫：

```
Encoder Block
```

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 核心区别

| Block 类型      | 是否 Mask  | 通信结构       | 用途          |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Encoder Block | 不加 Mask  | 全 token 互看 | 情感分析、机器翻译编码 |
| Decoder Block | 加三角 Mask | 只能看过去 + 当前 | 语言模型、文本生成   |

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 总结一句话

👉 Encoder Block：所有 token 互看，不加 mask
👉 Decoder Block：未来 token 不能看，加 mask，保持自回归

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你讲：

✅ Transformer 里的 Encoder-Decoder 结构是啥？
✅ GPT 是纯 Decoder，BERT 是纯 Encoder，为什么？
✅ Encoder 和 Decoder 怎么组合用？

# note 5: attention vs. self-attention vs. cross-attention

thing I wanted to comment on is you keep me you keep hearing me say attention self attention Etc there's actually also
something called cross attention what is the difference so basically the reason this attention
is self attention is because because the keys queries and the values are all
coming from the same Source from X so the same Source X produces Keys queries
and values so these nodes are self attending but in principle attention is
much more General than that so for example an encoder decoder Transformers uh you can have a case where the queries
are produced from X but the keys and the values come from a whole separate external source and sometimes from uh
encoder blocks that encode some context that we'd like to condition on and so the keys and the values will
actually come from a whole separate Source those are nodes on the side and here we're just producing queries and
we're reading off information from the side so cross attention is used when there's a separate source of nodes we'd
like to pull information from into our nodes and it's self attention if we just have nodes that would like to look at
each other and talk to each other so this attention here happens to be self
attention but in principle um attention is a lot more General okay and the last

当然可以！这一段讲的是 **attention / self-attention / cross-attention 有什么区别**，我来帮你详细解释 👇：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ Self-Attention 是什么？

👉 当前例子中，我们实现的是 **Self-Attention**，
👉 为什么叫 “Self”？

因为：

```
Q / K / V 全部来自同一个输入 X
```

也就是说：

```
Q = Linear_Q(X)  
K = Linear_K(X)  
V = Linear_V(X)
```

也就是：

👉 token 们自己看自己、彼此通信，**自我关注（self）**

---

### 📌 2️⃣ Cross-Attention 是什么？

👉 “Cross” 意思是 “跨来源”

具体来说：

```
Q 来自 X  
K / V 来自 另一个 Y
```

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 举例场景

✅ **Encoder-Decoder Transformer**（比如机器翻译）：

```
- 编码器 encoder → 得到 Y（context） → K/V  
- 解码器 decoder → 当前 X → Q  
- Cross-Attention：decoder 当前 token 用 Q 去看 encoder 产生的 K/V
```

---

### 📌 4️⃣ 通俗理解

| 类型              | Q 来自哪里 | K/V 来自哪里 | 举例                               |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Self-Attention  | X      | X        | GPT / BERT                       |
| Cross-Attention | X      | Y（别的来源）  | Encoder-Decoder Transformer 机器翻译 |

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 为什么需要 Cross-Attention？

因为有些任务：

✅ Decoder 需要 **参考外部信息**，比如：

* Encoder 产生的上下文
* 图像编码的结果
* 其他 modality 信息（多模态）

这时候，**Q 和 K/V 不同源**，就是 Cross-Attention。

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 总结一句话

**Self-Attention**：
👉 token 自己看自己，Q/K/V 同源

**Cross-Attention**：
👉 token 从“外部”提信息，Q ≠ K/V

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你继续讲：

✅ 为什么 Transformer 大模型（GPT-4V 等）会用 Cross-Attention？
✅ BERT 和 GPT 为什么只用 Self-Attention？
✅ Cross-Attention 怎么用来做“图文结合”？

# note 6: "scaled" self-attention. why divide by sqrt(head_size)

note at this stage is if we come to the attention is all need paper here we've already implemented attention so given
query key and value we've U multiplied the query and a key we've soft maxed it
and then we are aggregating the values there's one more thing that we're missing here which is the dividing by one / square root of the head size the
DK here is the head size why are they doing this finds this important so they call it the scaled attention and it's
kind of like an important normalization to basically have the problem is if you have unit gsh
and inputs so zero mean unit variance K and Q are unit gashin then if you just do we naively then you see that your we
actually will be uh the variance will be on the order of head size which in our case is 16 but if you multiply by one
over head size square root so this is square root and this is one over then the variance of we will be one
so it will be preserved now why is this important you'll not notice that way
here will feed into softmax and so it's really important especially at initialization that we be
fairly diffuse so in our case here we sort of locked out here and we had a
fairly diffuse numbers here so um like this now the problem is that because of
softmax if weight takes on very positive and very negative numbers inside it softmax will actually converge towards
one hot vectors and so I can illustrate that here um say we are applying softmax
to a tensor of values that are very close to zero then we're going to get a diffuse thing out of softmax but the moment I take the exact
same thing and I start sharpening it making it bigger by multiplying these numbers by eight for example you'll see
that the softmax will start to sharpen and in fact it will sharpen towards the max so it will sharpen towards whatever
number here is the highest and so um basically we don't want these values to be too extreme especially at
initialization otherwise softmax will be way too peaky and um you're basically aggregating um information from like a
single node every node just agregates information from a single other node that's not what we want especially at
initialization and so the scaling is used just to control the variance at initialization okay so having said all

当然可以！这段在讲 **为什么 Self-Attention 要除以 √head\_size，叫做“scaled attention”**，我来帮你详细解释 👇：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ 原始 Attention 公式

到目前为止我们实现的 attention 是：

```
wei = q @ k.T   → (B, T, T)  
wei = softmax(wei)  
out = wei @ v
```

---

### 📌 2️⃣ 论文里多了一个除法：

```
wei = (q @ k.T) / sqrt(head_size)
```

这里的 **head\_size = d\_k**
也就是 q 和 k 的维度（比如 16）

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 为什么要除？

核心问题：

👉 如果 **q / k** 向量是 “零均值，单位方差（unit Gaussian）”，
👉 那么 **q @ k.T** 的输出，方差会是 **head\_size 大小**。

因为：

```
Var(q ⋅ k) ~ head_size
```

---

### 📌 4️⃣ 如果不除，softmax 会出什么问题？

* softmax 对 wei 做指数运算：

```
softmax(x) = exp(x) / sum(exp(x))
```

* 如果 wei 很大（比如 mean=0，但 variance 很大）：

👉 softmax 会变得非常“尖锐（peaky）”：

```
softmax ≈ one-hot  
→ 只看一个 token，丢失其余信息
```

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 为什么 variance 大？

q @ k.T：

```
q.shape = (T, head_size)  
k.shape = (T, head_size)
```

q\_i ⋅ k\_j 是 **head\_size 个数的乘积求和**，
→ 方差 ≈ head\_size

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 除以 sqrt(head\_size) 有什么用？

👉 这样可以把 variance 控制到 ≈ 1，
👉 softmax 输出会“平滑、扩散”一些，不会一上来就变成 one-hot

---

### 📌 7️⃣ 举例说明

假设：

```
wei = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
softmax(wei) → 比较均匀
```

但如果：

```
wei = [10, 20, 30]
softmax(wei) → 变得非常 one-hot
```

---

### 📌 8️⃣ 总结一句话

👉 除以 √head\_size 是为了 **控制 q⋅k.T 的方差**，
👉 防止 softmax 输出过于尖锐，避免一开始就 over-confident，
👉 这样模型初始化时更容易收敛、更稳定。

---

如果你想，我还可以帮你继续讲：

✅ 为什么 head\_size 越大越要除？
✅ 如果不用这个 scale 会发生什么？
✅ 有没有别的方法来 normalize attention？

# inserting a single self-attention block to our network

that let's now take our self attention knowledge and let's uh take it for a spin so here in the code I created this
head module and it implements a single head of self attention so you give it a head size and then here it creates the
key query and the value linear layers typically people don't use biases in these uh so those are the linear
projections that we're going to apply to all of our nodes now here I'm creating this Trill variable Trill is not a
parameter of the module so in sort of pytorch naming conventions uh this is called a buffer it's not a parameter and
you have to call it you have to assign it to the module using a register buffer so that creates the trill uh the triang
lower triangular Matrix and we're given the input X this should look very familiar now we calculate the keys the
queries we C calculate the attention scores inside way uh we normalize it so
we're using scaled attention here then we make sure that uh future doesn't communicate with the past so this makes
it a decoder block and then softmax and then aggregate the value and
output then here in the language model I'm creating a head in the Constructor and I'm calling it self attention head
and the head size I'm going to keep as the same and embed just for
now and then here once we've encoded the information with the token embeddings
and the position embeddings we're simply going to feed it into the self attention head and then the output of that is
going to go into uh the decoder language modeling head and create the logits so
this the sort of the simplest way to plug in a self attention component uh into our Network right now I had to make
one more change which is that here in the generate uh we have to make sure
that our idx that we feed into the model because now we're using positional embeddings we can never have more than
block size coming in because if idx is more than block size then our position
embedding table is going to run out of scope because it only has embeddings for up to block size and so therefore I
added some uh code here to crop the context that we're going to feed into
self um so that uh we never pass in more than block siiz elements
so those are the changes and let's Now train the network okay so I also came up to the script here and I decreased the
learning rate because uh the self attention can't tolerate very very high learning rates and then I also increased
number of iterations because the learning rate is lower and then I trained it and previously we were only able to get to up to 2.5 and now we are
down to 2.4 so we definitely see a little bit of an improvement from 2.5 to 2.4 roughly uh but the text is still not
amazing so clearly the self attention head is doing some useful communication
but um we still have a long way to go okay so now we've implemented the scale. product attention now next up and the

当然可以！这一段在讲 **如何把 self-attention block 插入到现有的网络里**，我来帮你详细解释 👇：

---

### 📌 1️⃣ 新建了一个 Head 模块

```python
class Head(nn.Module):
    ...
```

这个模块实现的是：

👉 一个 **单头 self-attention**（single-head attention）

---

### 📌 2️⃣ Head 里有什么？

* 创建了 3 个 `nn.Linear` 层：

```
key = nn.Linear(...)  
query = nn.Linear(...)  
value = nn.Linear(...)  
```

→ 用来做 Q/K/V 的 projection

👉 通常这些 projection **不用 bias**，保持纯线性映射

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 加入 Trill（三角 mask）

* 创建了一个 **lower triangular mask**（tril）：

```
tril = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))
```

作用：

👉 保证 decoder block 不看未来
👉 实现 **自回归**，防止 token 看到未来 token

---

### 📌 4️⃣ tril 是 Buffer

为什么叫 “buffer” 而不是 parameter？

👉 因为 tril 是 **固定的，不需要训练**
👉 用 `register_buffer` 把 tril 注册进模块，保存模型时不会漏掉

---

### 📌 5️⃣ Forward 流程

* 给定输入 `x`，流程是：

```
key = Linear(x)  
query = Linear(x)  
value = Linear(x)
```

* 计算 Attention Score：

```
wei = (q @ k.T) / sqrt(head_size)
```

* 加 mask，softmax，求 weighted sum：

```
wei = softmax(masked wei)  
out = wei @ value
```

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 如何插入到语言模型？

在 language model 里：

```
self.sa_head = Head(head_size)
```

---

### 📌 7️⃣ Forward 调用

原来 embedding + positional embedding → 直接用到 output
现在：

```
x = token_embedding + positional_embedding  
x = self.sa_head(x)  
x → decoder head → logits
```

---

### 📌 8️⃣ 生成时注意事项

因为现在用了 positional embedding：

👉 必须保证 **生成时 context <= block\_size**
👉 所以 `generate` 里加了截断逻辑，防止超范围访问 position embedding

---

### 📌 9️⃣ 训练结果

* learning rate 要调小
* iteration 要变多

结果：

* loss 从 2.5 → 2.4
* 文本质量 **稍微提升**，但还没到“很聪明”

---

### 📌 10️⃣ 总结一句话

👉 这一段讲的就是：

✅ 如何封装 self-attention 成模块
✅ 如何插入到 language model
✅ 如何训练 / 生成时处理位置
✅ 观察效果：能明显提升，但还需要更复杂网络

如果你想，我还可以帮你继续讲：

✅ 为什么单头 attention 效果有限？
✅ 下一步多头 attention 怎么做？
✅ 为什么 self-attention head 不需要 bias？

# multi-headed self-attention

attention is all you need paper there's something called multi-head attention and what is multi-head attention it's
just applying multiple attentions in parallel and concatenating their results so they have a little bit of diagram
here I don't know if this is super clear it's really just multiple attentions in
parallel so let's Implement that fairly straightforward if we want a multi-head attention then
we want multiple heads of self attention running in parallel so in pytorch we can
do this by simply creating multiple heads so however heads how however many
heads you want and then what is the head size of each and then we run all of them
in parallel into a list and simply concatenate all of the outputs and we're
concatenating over the channel Dimension so the way this looks now is we don't have just a single ATT
that uh has a hit size of 32 because remember n Ed is 32 instead of having one Communication
channel we now have four communication channels in parallel and each one of these communication channels typically
will be uh smaller uh correspondingly so because we have four communication
channels we want eight dimensional self attention and so from each Communication channel we're going to together eight
dimensional vectors and then we have four of them and that concatenates to give us 32 which is the original and
embed and so this is kind of similar to um if you're familiar with convolutions this is kind of like a group convolution
uh because basically instead of having one large convolution we do convolution in groups and uh that's multi-headed
self attention and so then here we just use essay heads self attention heads instead
now I actually ran it and uh scrolling down I ran the same thing and then we
now get this down to 2.28 roughly and the output is still the generation is
still not amazing but clearly the validation loss is improving because we were at 2.4 just now and so it helps to
have multiple communication channels because obviously these tokens have a lot to talk about they want to find the
consonants the vowels they want to find the vowels just from certain positions uh they want to find any kinds of
different things and so it helps to create multiple independent channels of communication gather lots of different
types of data and then uh decode the output now going back to the paper for a second of course I didn't explain this

当然可以！这段在讲 **Multi-Head Attention（多头注意力）**，我来帮你详细解释 👇：

### 📌 1️⃣ 什么是 Multi-Head Attention？

👉 就是 **多个 Self-Attention 头并行运行**，
👉 然后 **把它们的输出拼接起来**

---

### 📌 2️⃣ 为什么要多个 Head？

一个单独的 attention head：

```
只能学习一种“关注模式”
```

比如：

* 找元音
* 找名词
* 找某种语法依赖

---

多个 head：

```
每个 head 学一种不同的“关注模式”  
可以捕捉到更多不同类型的信息
```

---

### 📌 3️⃣ 结构图示意

论文图：

```
多个 parallel attention head → 拼接 concat → 最后统一 projection
```

### 📌 4️⃣ 代码怎么实现？

在 PyTorch 里：

```
self.heads = nn.ModuleList([Head(head_size) for _ in range(num_heads)])
```

* 例如：

```
embed_size = 32  
num_heads = 4  
head_size = 8  # 因为 32 / 4 = 8
```

→ 每个 head 输出 8 维，总共拼成 32 维。

---

### 📌 5️⃣ 为什么像 Group Convolution？

* 普通 conv 是：

```
所有通道全卷积
```

* Group Conv 是：

```
每组卷积器单独卷一部分通道，最后拼接
```

Multi-Head Attention 类似：

```
多个 head 各自注意一部分“信息关系” → 拼接
```

---

### 📌 6️⃣ 实验结果

训练结果：

* 原来单头 Attention，val loss \~ 2.4
* 现在 4 头 Multi-Head Attention，val loss \~ 2.28

---

### 📌 7️⃣ 为什么 Multi-Head 有用？

因为 token 之间的关系 **很复杂**：

* 有时关注拼写模式
* 有时关注语法
* 有时关注词性
* 有时关注上下文意义

**多个 head = 多种关注能力**

---

### 📌 8️⃣ 总结一句话

👉 Multi-Head Attention 就是：

✅ 多个 Attention Head 并行运行
✅ 每个 Head 学不同关注模式
✅ 输出拼接后更丰富，效果更好

---

如果你还想，我可以继续帮你讲：

✅ Multi-Head Attention 最终还要不要 projection？
✅ 多头是“加法”还是“拼接”？
✅ 为什么 GPT 用很多 head，BERT 用更多 head？

要不要我继续讲？🌟


# feedforward layers of transformer block

figure in full detail but we are starting to see some components of what we've already implemented we have the positional encodings the token encodings
that add we have the masked multi-headed attention implemented now here's another
multi-headed attention which is a cross attention to an encoder which we haven't we're not going to implement in this
case I'm going to come back to that later but I want you to notice that there's a feed forward part here and
then this is grouped into a block that gets repeat it again and again now the feedforward part here is just a simple
uh multi-layer perceptron um so the multi-headed so here position
wise feed forward networks is just a simple little MLP so I want to start basically in a similar fashion also
adding computation into the network and this computation is on a per node level
so I've already implemented it and you can see the diff highlighted on the left here when I've added or changed things
now before we had the self multi-headed self attention that did the communication but we went way too fast
to calculate the logits so the tokens looked at each other but didn't really have a lot of time to think on what they
found from the other tokens and so what I've implemented here is a little feet
forward single layer and this little layer is just a linear followed by a Rel nonlinearity and that's that's it so
it's just a little layer and then I call it feed forward um and embed
and then this feed forward is just called sequentially right after the self attention so we self attend then we feed
forward and you'll notice that the feet forward here when it's applying linear this is on a per token level all the
tokens do this independently so the self attention is the communication and then once they've gathered all the data now
they need to think on that data individually and so that's what feed forward is doing and that's why I've
added it here now when I train this the validation LW actually continues to go down now to 2. 24 which is down from
2.28 uh the output still look kind of terrible but at least we've improved the situation and so as a preview we're
going to now start to intersperse the communication with the computation and
that's also what the Transformer does when it has blocks that communicate and then compute and it groups them and
replicates them okay so let me show you what we'd like to do we'd like to do

这段话讲的是 Transformer 中的一个重要组成部分：**前馈神经网络（Feedforward Layer）**，它在注意力机制之后被插入进来，提供每个 token 单独的处理能力。以下是通俗易懂的中文解释：

---

## 💡 这段讲了什么？

在 Transformer 结构中，除了多头自注意力（multi-head self-attention），还有一个关键部分叫做 **前馈网络（Feedforward Layer）**。

* 多头注意力：让每个 token 可以和其它 token 交互、交流信息（"沟通"）
* 前馈网络：让每个 token 单独做思考和计算（"思考"）

---

## 🧠 作者为什么要加入 Feedforward 层？

原来模型结构是这样的：

```text
TokenEmbedding + PositionalEmbedding
        ↓
Multi-Head Self Attention（token 间沟通）
        ↓
Linear 输出 logits（太快了，还没思考就输出）
```

作者觉得：token 之间虽然沟通了，但**还没来得及思考**，就直接做预测了，这不合理！

于是他加了一个前馈层（Feedforward）让每个 token **自己思考**刚刚收到的信息：

```text
Self Attention（沟通）
→ FeedForward（独立思考）
→ 输出 logits（最终预测）
```

---

## ⚙️ Feedforward 层是怎么实现的？

在代码中，其实就是非常简单的一个两层神经网络：

```python
self.ffwd = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(n_embd, n_embd),
    nn.ReLU()
)
```

然后在前向传播中加入：

```python
x = self.sa_head(x)  # 自注意力，token 之间互相交流
x = self.ffwd(x)     # 前馈网络，每个 token 自己处理数据
```

注意：这个前馈是 **逐个 token 独立进行的**，不像 self-attention 会跨 token。

---

## 🎯 为什么这么设计？

* 自注意力是**横向信息流**（token 之间沟通）
* 前馈网络是**纵向信息处理**（每个 token 内部分析）

这两个结合起来，形成完整的处理流程：

> “听完别人说话”（self-attention） → “自己想一想”（feedforward） → “决定怎么做”（输出预测）

---

## ✅ 效果如何？

* 模型训练后的损失（loss）从 2.28 降到了 2.24
* 输出文本虽然还不完美，但确实有所提升
* 表明 feedforward 层确实起了作用

---

## 🧱 最后一句话总结

> Feedforward 层让每个 token 在收到其它 token 信息后，**进行独立思考和处理**，这一步对最终预测非常关键。

如果你想，我可以画一张图帮你可视化 self-attention 和 feedforward 的关系。需要吗？


# residual connections

something like this we have a block and this block is is basically this part here except for the cross
attention now the block basically intersperses communication and then computation the computation the
communication is done using multi-headed selfelf attention and then the computation is done using a feed forward
Network on all the tokens independently now what I've added here
also is you'll notice this takes the number of embeddings in the embedding Dimension
and number of heads that we would like which is kind of like group size in group convolution and and I'm saying
that number of heads we'd like is four and so because this is 32 we calculate that because this is 32 the number of
heads should be four um the head size should be eight so that everything sort
of works out Channel wise um so this is how the Transformer structures uh sort of the uh the sizes typically so the
head size will become eight and then this is how we want to intersperse them and then here I'm trying to create
blocks which is just a sequential application of block block block so that we're interspersing communication feed
forward many many times and then finally we decode now I actually tried to run
this and the problem is this doesn't actually give a very good uh answer and very good result and the reason for that
is we're start starting to actually get like a pretty deep neural net and deep neural Nets uh suffer from optimization
issues and I think that's what we're kind of like slightly starting to run into so we need one more idea that we can borrow from the um Transformer paper
to resolve those difficulties now there are two optimizations that dramatically help with the depth of these networks
and make sure that the networks remain optimizable let's talk about the first one the first one in this diagram is you
see this Arrow here and then this arrow and this Arrow those are skip connections or sometimes called residual
connections they come from this paper uh the presidual learning for image recognition from about
2015 uh that introduced the concept now these are basically what it means is you
transform data but then you have a skip connection with addition from the previous features now the way I like to
visualize it uh that I prefer is the following here the computation happens
from the top to bottom and basically you have this uh residual pathway and you
are free to Fork off from the residual pathway perform some computation and then project back to the residual
pathway via addition and so you go from the the uh inputs to the targets only
via plus and plus plus and the reason this is useful is because during back propagation remember from our microG
grad video earlier addition distributes gradients equally to both of its branches that that fed as the input and
so the supervision or the gradients from the loss basically hop through every
addition node all the way to the input and then also Fork off into the residual
blocks but basically you have this gradient Super Highway that goes directly from the supervision all the
way to the input unimpeded and then these viral blocks are usually initialized in the beginning so they
contribute very very little if anything to the residual pathway they they are initialized that way so in the beginning
they are sort of almost kind of like not there but then during the optimization they come online over time and they uh
start to contribute but at least at the initialization you can go from directly supervision to the input gradient is
unimpeded and just flows and then the blocks over time kick in and so that dramatically helps
with the optimization so let's implement this so coming back to our block here basically what we want to do is we want
to do xal X+ self attention and xal X+ self. feed
forward so this is X and then we Fork off and do some communication and come
back and we Fork off and we do some computation and come back so those are residual connections and then swinging
back up here we also have to introd use this projection so nn.
linear and uh this is going to be from after we concatenate this this is
the prze and embed so this is the output of the self tension itself but then we
actually want the uh to apply the projection and that's the result so the projection is just a
linear transformation of the outcome of this layer so that's the projection back into the virual pathway and then here in a
feet forward it's going to be the same same thing I could have a a self doot projection here as well but let me just
simplify it and let me uh couple it inside the same sequential container and
so this is the projection layer going back into the residual pathway and
so that's uh well that's it so now we can train this so I implemented one more small change when you look into the
paper again you see that the dimensionality of input and output is 512 for them and they're saying that the
inner layer here in the feet forward has dimensionality of 248 so there's a multiplier of four and so the inner
layer of the feet forward Network should be multiplied by four in terms of Channel sizes so I came here and I
multiplied four times embed here for the feed forward and then from four times nmed coming back down to nmed when we go
back to the pro uh to the projection so adding a bit of computation here and growing that layer that is in the
residual block on the side of the residual pathway and then I train this and we
actually get down all the way to uh 2.08 validation loss and we also see that network is starting to get big enough
that our train loss is getting ahead of validation loss so we're starting to see like a little bit of overfitting and um our our
um uh Generations here are still not amazing but at least you see that we can see like is here this now grief syn like
this starts to almost look like English so um yeah we're starting to really get there okay and the second Innovation

这段讲的是 Transformer 中一个非常重要的结构设计 —— **残差连接（Residual Connection）**，它的作用是帮助深层神经网络更容易训练。下面我会通俗地讲解这段内容。

---

## 🌉 一、残差连接是什么？

残差连接（Residual Connection），也叫 **跳跃连接（Skip Connection）**，就是在神经网络中的某一层做完变换后，把输入 **加回去**。

用一句话总结：

> "你变换了一些信息，我把变换后的结果，和原始信息直接加起来。"

举个例子（假设我们要处理一个向量 `x`）：

```python
out = x + f(x)
```

* `f(x)` 是某层网络（比如 self-attention 或 MLP）计算的结果。
* `x` 是输入。
* `out` 是“残差连接”后的结果。

---

## 🧠 二、为什么残差连接有用？

因为深层网络很难训练，残差连接解决了几个大问题：

### ✅ 问题1：梯度消失/爆炸

在深层网络中，**梯度会越来越小或越来越大**，导致学习停滞或不稳定。

👉 残差连接通过“加法”方式，让梯度可以**顺着加法直接流向前面层**，而不需要穿越多个层的变换，像高速公路一样。

### ✅ 问题2：网络太深，反而变差

原始网络（没有残差连接）越深，性能可能反而变差（准确率下降）。

👉 加上残差连接后，如果某一层学不好，它可以选择“什么都不做”，因为 `x + 0 = x`，这就允许网络**跳过那一层的影响**，更容易优化。

---

## 🔧 三、代码实现逻辑（简化版）

```python
x = ... # 输入向量
x = x + self_attention(x)   # 第一次残差连接
x = x + feed_forward(x)     # 第二次残差连接
```

每一块模块（比如 Self-Attention 和 FeedForward）都插在残差路径的旁边，先“分叉出去”，然后再加回来。

---

## 🧪 四、注意几个技术细节

1. **残差路径中通常会加一个 `Linear` 层**，用于把变换结果的维度“投影”回来，使得可以和原始输入相加（维度必须匹配）。

2. **MLP 通常会加宽 4 倍**（例如 `nn.Linear(n_embd, 4*n_embd)`），再用 ReLU，然后再压缩回来（`nn.Linear(4*n_embd, n_embd)`）。这样有更强的表达能力。

---

## 🏗️ 五、最终结构

一个典型的 Transformer Block（只考虑 decoder block）：

```
x ——➤ [Multi-head Self-Attention] ——➤ +
|                                    |
+—————————➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤

(接着再来一次...)

x ——➤ [FeedForward（MLP）] ——➤ +
|                              |
+———————————➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤➤
```

---

## ✨ 总结一句话：

> 残差连接就像是信息高速公路，让信息和梯度都可以**直接穿过网络层**，既不丢信息，又利于训练，是深层 Transformer 能成功的核心设计之一。

需要我画个图或者用动画帮你更清楚理解这个“分叉再合并”的流程吗？


# layernorm (and its relationship to our previous batchnorm)

that is very helpful for optimizing very deep neural networks is right here so we have this addition now that's the
residual part but this Norm is referring to something called layer Norm so layer Norm is implemented in pytorch it's a
paper that came out a while back here um and layer Norm is very very similar
to bash Norm so remember back to our make more series part three we implemented bash
normalization and uh bash normalization basically just made sure that um Across
The Bash dimension any individual neuron had unit uh Gan um distribution so it
was zero mean and unit standard deviation one standard deviation output
so what I did here is I'm copy pasting the bashor 1D that we developed in our make more series and see here we can
initialize for example this module and we can have a batch of 32 100 dimensional vectors feeding through the
bachor layer so what this does is it guarantees that when we look at just the
zeroth column it's a zero mean one standard deviation so it's normalizing
every single column of this uh input now the rows are not uh going to be
normalized by default because we're just normalizing columns so let's now Implement layer Norm uh it's very
complicated look we come here we change this from zero to one so we don't
normalize The Columns we normalize the rows and now we've implemented layer
Norm so now the columns are not going to be normalized um but the rows are going to
be normalized for every individual example it's 100 dimensional Vector is normalized uh in this way and because
our computation Now does not span across examples we can delete all of this
buffers stuff uh because uh we can always apply this operation and don't
need to maintain any running buffers so we don't need the buffers uh we
don't There's no distinction between training and test time uh and we don't need these running
buffers we do keep gamma and beta we don't need the momentum we don't care if it's training or not and this is now a
layer norm and it normalizes the rows instead of the columns and this here is
identical to basically this here so let's now Implement layer Norm in our
Transformer before I incorporate the layer Norm I just wanted to note that as I said very few details about the
Transformer have changed in the last 5 years but this is actually something that slightly departs from the original paper you see that the ADD and Norm is
applied after the transformation but um in now it is a bit
more uh basically common to apply the layer Norm before the transformation so there's a reshuffling of the layer Norms
uh so this is called the prorm formulation and that's the one that we're going to implement as well so select deviation from the original paper
basically we need two layer Norms layer Norm one is uh NN do layer norm and we
tell it how many um what is the embedding Dimension and we need the second layer norm and then here the
layer Norms are applied immediately on X so self. layer Norm one applied on X and
self. layer Norm two applied on X before it goes into self attention and feed
forward and uh the size of the layer Norm here is an ed so 32 so when the
layer Norm is normalizing our features it is uh the normalization here uh
happens the mean and the variance are taken over 32 numbers so the batch and the time act as batch Dimensions both of
them so this is kind of like a per token um transformation that just normalizes
the features and makes them a unit mean uh unit Gan at
initialization but of course because these layer Norms inside it have these gamma and beta training
parameters uh the layer Norm will U eventually create outputs that might not
be unit gion but the optimization will determine that so for now this is the uh
this is incorporating the layer norms and let's train them on okay so I let it run and we see that we get down to 2.06
which is better than the previous 2.08 so a slight Improvement by adding the layer norms and I'd expect that they
help uh even more if we had bigger and deeper Network one more thing I forgot to add is that there should be a layer
Norm here also typically as at the end of the Transformer and right before the
final uh linear layer that decodes into vocabulary so I added that as well so at
this stage we actually have a pretty complete uh Transformer according to the original paper and it's a decoder only
Transformer I'll I'll talk about that in a second uh but at this stage uh the major pieces are in place so we can try
to scale this up and see how well we can push this number now in order to scale out the model I had to perform some

这段内容讲的是 Transformer 中的另一个核心技巧 —— **LayerNorm（层归一化）**，它的作用是让深层网络更容易训练，尤其是在加了残差连接之后。下面我用通俗语言解释这个内容。

---

## 🧠 一、什么是 LayerNorm？

**LayerNorm（层归一化）** 是一种对每一个样本（token）**单独做归一化**的操作。

> 它和 BatchNorm 类似，区别是：
>
> * **BatchNorm** 是对“同一个位置的神经元”在一个 batch 中跨样本做归一化。
> * **LayerNorm** 是对“同一个样本（token）”的所有特征做归一化。

---

### ✅ 举个例子：

假设一个 token 的向量是这样（有 4 个维度）：

```python
x = [2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0]
```

**LayerNorm** 会做以下几步：

1. 计算均值 mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 5.0
2. 计算标准差 std = √((差平方的平均)) = 2.236
3. 对每个值做归一化：

   ```
   x_norm = [(2-5)/2.236, (4-5)/2.236, (6-5)/2.236, (8-5)/2.236]
          ≈ [-1.34, -0.45, 0.45, 1.34]
   ```

这样，输出的每个 token 向量的均值是 0，标准差是 1。

> **它是对每个 token 独立处理的！不受 batch size 的影响。**

---

## 🏗️ 二、为什么 LayerNorm 对 Transformer 特别重要？

1. **结合残差连接使用**：

   * Transformer 中使用了残差连接：`x + f(x)`，防止网络太深导致训练困难。
   * 但残差会带来“数值不稳定”：叠加的结果可能越来越大。
   * LayerNorm 在这里起到了“稳定输出”的作用，让训练更容易收敛。

2. **适合序列任务**：

   * BatchNorm 在 NLP 中不太好用，因为句子长度不同，batch size 小。
   * LayerNorm 不依赖 batch 大小或位置，是对每个 token 向量单独处理，非常适合 Transformer。

---

## 🧪 三、在代码中如何用 LayerNorm？

```python
self.ln1 = nn.LayerNorm(n_embd)  # 对每个 token 的 n_embd 维向量做归一化
self.ln2 = nn.LayerNorm(n_embd)
```

然后在前向传播中这样使用：

```python
x = x + self.attn(self.ln1(x))     # 残差连接 + 层归一化
x = x + self.ffwd(self.ln2(x))     # 再来一次
```

这个方式叫做 **Pre-LN（前归一化）**，相比论文中的 Post-LN 更稳定、更常用。

---

## 🧩 四、LayerNorm 还保留可学习参数

虽然它把输出变成了“均值为 0、方差为 1”的形式，但它还保留了两个参数：

```python
output = γ * x_norm + β
```

* γ（gamma）：每个特征的缩放系数
* β（beta）：每个特征的偏移量

这些参数是可以学习的，最终网络会学会是否需要“拉伸”或“平移”每个维度。

---

## ✅ 总结一句话：

> **LayerNorm 是对每个 token 的向量做标准化处理，使训练更加稳定、收敛更快，是 Transformer 成功的核心技巧之一。**

需要我配图说明“LayerNorm 与 BatchNorm 的区别”，或者“残差 + LayerNorm 的结构图”吗？


# scaling up the model! creating a few variables. adding dropout

cosmetic changes here to make it nicer so I introduced this variable called n layer which just specifies how many
layers of the blocks we're going to have I created a bunch of blocks and we have a new variable number of heads as well I
pulled out the layer Norm here and uh so this is identical now one thing that I did briefly change is I added a Dropout
so Dropout is something that you can add right before the residual connection back right before the connection back
into the residual pathway so we can drop out that as l layer here we can drop out
uh here at the end of the multi-headed exension as well and we can also drop out here uh when we calculate the um
basically affinities and after the softmax we can drop out some of those so we can randomly prevent some of the
nodes from communicating and so Dropout uh comes from this paper from 2014 or so and
basically it takes your neural nut and it randomly every forward backward pass shuts off some subset of
uh neurons so randomly drops them to zero and trains without them and what
this does effectively is because the mask of what's being dropped out is changed every single forward backward
pass it ends up kind of uh training an ensemble of sub networks and then at
test time everything is fully enabled and kind of all of those sub networks are merged into a single Ensemble if you
can if you want to think about it that way so I would read the paper to get the full detail for now we're just going to
stay on the level of this is a regularization technique and I added it because I'm about to scale up the model
quite a bit and I was concerned about overfitting so now when we scroll up to the top uh we'll see that I changed a
number of hyper parameters here about our neural nut so I made the batch size be much larger now it's 64 I changed the
block size to be 256 so previously it was just eight eight characters of context now it is 256 characters of
context to predict the 257th uh I brought down the learning rate a
little bit because the neural net is now much bigger so I brought down the learning rate the embedding Dimension is
now 384 and there are six heads so 384 divide 6 means that every head is 64
dimensional as it as a standard and then there's going to be six layers of that
and the Dropout will be at 02 so every forward backward pass 20% of all of these um intermediate calculations are
disabled and dropped to zero and then I already trained this and I ran it so uh drum roll how well does it
perform so let me just scroll up here we get a validation loss of
1.48 which is actually quite a bit of an improvement on what we had before which I think was 2.07 so it went from 2.07
all the way down to 1.48 just by scaling up this neural nut with the code that we have and this of course ran for a lot
longer this maybe trained for I want to say about 15 minutes on my a100 GPU so
that's a pretty a GPU and if you don't have a GPU you're not going to be able to reproduce this uh on a CPU this would
be um I would not run this on a CPU or MacBook or something like that you'll have to Brak down the number of uh
layers and the embedding Dimension and so on uh but in about 15 minutes we can get this kind of a result and um I'm
printing some of the Shakespeare here but what I did also is I printed 10,000 characters so a lot more and I wrote
them to a file and so here we see some of the outputs
so it's a lot more recognizable as the input text file so the input text file just for reference looked like this so
there's always like someone speaking in this manner and uh our predictions now
take on that form except of course they're they're nonsensical when you actually read them
so it is every crimp tap be a house oh those
prepation we give heed um you know
Oho sent me you mighty Lord anyway so you can read through this
um it's nonsensical of course but this is just a Transformer trained on a character level for 1 million characters
that come from Shakespeare so there's sort of like blabbers on in Shakespeare like manner but it doesn't of course
make sense at this scale uh but I think I think still a pretty good demonstration of what's
possible so now I think uh that kind of like concludes
the programming section of this video we basically kind of uh did a pretty good job and um of implementing this
Transformer uh but the picture doesn't exactly match up to what we've done so what's going on with all these digital
Parts here so let me finish explaining this architecture and why it looks so funky basically what's happening here is

这段内容讲解了如何对 Transformer 模型进行**扩展**，以及在模型训练过程中如何加入 **Dropout** 和一些 **超参数调整**，以防止过拟合并提高性能。下面我将通俗易懂地讲解。

---

## 🧑‍💻 一、增加 Dropout

### ✅ 什么是 Dropout？

**Dropout** 是一种正则化技术，作用是**在训练过程中随机丢弃一些神经元（或连接）**。
这可以帮助模型减少对某些特定神经元的依赖，从而避免过拟合。

* 每次训练时，网络中一些神经元（或连接）会被**随机“关掉”**（即输出设为零）。
* 这样可以模拟多个子网络的训练效果，最终测试时网络是完全启用的。

### ✅ 为什么在 Transformer 中使用 Dropout？

在扩展模型时，**模型会变得更大、更复杂**，容易过拟合。
通过 **Dropout**，模型在每次前向传播和反向传播时都会使用不同的神经元组合，防止模型“记住”训练数据的噪声，提高泛化能力。

---

## 🛠️ 二、扩展模型的超参数调整

为了让模型变得更强大，作者调整了几个重要的超参数：

### 1. **增大批处理大小（Batch Size）**

* 之前的批处理大小是 4，现在增大到 **64**，意味着每次训练会用更多的样本。

### 2. **增大上下文块大小（Block Size）**

* 之前是每次处理 **8** 个字符的上下文，现在扩展到 **256** 个字符，这样模型能理解更长的上下文。

### 3. **减小学习率（Learning Rate）**

* 模型变大后，学习率需要**调小**，否则容易震荡，导致训练不稳定。

### 4. **增加嵌入维度（Embedding Dimension）**

* 嵌入维度从 32 增加到 **384**，每个头的大小从 32 降到 64，这样可以处理更多的特征。

### 5. **增加 Transformer 层数（Number of Layers）**

* 之前只有几层，现在增加了 **6 层**，让模型更强大。

### 6. **设置 Dropout 比例**

* 设置 **0.2 的 Dropout**，意味着在每次训练时，20% 的神经元会被随机丢弃。

---

## 📈 三、训练效果

经过这些调整，训练后的 **验证损失（validation loss）** 从 **2.07** 降到 **1.48**，表明模型性能大幅提升。
虽然输出文本还是不完美，但已经更像莎士比亚的风格了，能够看到一些可识别的单词和结构。

---

## 🎭 四、生成的文本

模型生成的文本看起来像是莎士比亚的风格，但其实是**无意义的**。例如：

> "every crimp tap be a house oh those prepation we give heed..."

这些文本虽然看似有点道理，但其实是完全无意义的，毕竟模型训练的只是字符级别的语言模型。

---

## 🧩 五、总结

1. **Dropout** 帮助模型避免过拟合，提高了模型的泛化能力。
2. 增大了批处理大小、上下文大小等超参数，使得模型可以学习更丰富的特征。
3. 训练后的 **验证损失显著下降**，尽管生成的文本不完美，但已经显示出莎士比亚风格的特征。

这些调整使得模型更加强大，且能处理更复杂的任务。

如果你有任何问题，或者想更深入地理解模型的细节，随时可以问我！


# encoder vs. decoder vs. both (?) Transformers

what we implemented here is a decoder only Transformer so there's no component here this part is called the encoder and
there's no cross attention block here our block only has a self attention and
the feet forward so it is missing this third in between piece here this piece
does cross attention so we don't have it and we don't have the encoder we just have the decoder and the reason we have
a decoder only uh is because we are just uh generating text and it's unconditioned on anything we're just
we're just blabbering on according to a given data set what makes it a decoder is that we are using the Triangular mask
in our uh trans former so it has this Auto regressive property where we can just uh go and sample from it so the
fact that it's using the Triangular triangular mask to mask out the attention makes it a decoder and it can
be used for language modeling now the reason that the original paper had an incoder decoder architecture is because
it is a machine translation paper so it is concerned with a different setting in particular it expects some uh tokens
that encode say for example French and then it is expecting to decode the translation in English so so you
typically these here are special tokens so you are expected to read in this and
condition on it and then you start off the generation with a special token called start so this is a special new
token um that you introduce and always place in the beginning and then the network is expected to Output neural
networks are awesome and then a special end token to finish the generation so this part here will be
decoded exactly as we we've done it neural networks are awesome will be identical to what we did but unlike what
we did they wanton to condition the generation on some additional information and in that case this
additional information is the French sentence that they should be translating so what they do now is they
bring in the encoder now the encoder reads this part here so we're only going
to take the part of French and we're going to uh create tokens from it exactly as we've seen in our video and
we're going to put a Transformer on it but there's going to be no triangular mask and so all the tokens are allowed
to talk to each other as much as they want and they're just encoding whatever's the content of this French uh
sentence once they've encoded it they they basically come out in the top here
and then what happens here is in our decoder which does the uh language modeling there's an additional
connection here to the outputs of the encoder and that is brought in through a cross
attention so the queries are still generated from X but now the keys and the values are coming from the side the
keys and the values are coming from the top generated by the nodes that came outside of the de the encoder and those
tops the keys and the values there the top of it feed in on a side into every
single block of the decoder and so that's why there's an additional cross attention and really what it's doing is
it's conditioning the decoding not just on the past of this current decoding but also on having seen the
full fully encoded French um prompt sort of and so it's an encoder decoder model
which is why we have those two Transformers an additional block and so on so we did not do this because we have
no we have nothing to encode there's no conditioning we just have a text file and we just want to imitate it and that's why we are using a decoder only
Transformer exactly as done in GPT okay okay so now I wanted to do a

这段内容讲解了 **Encoder-Decoder Transformer** 和 **Decoder-only Transformer** 的区别，特别是它们在 **机器翻译** 和 **语言建模** 中的不同应用。

---

## 🧠 一、我们实现的是 **Decoder-only Transformer**

### ✅ 什么是 **Decoder-only Transformer**？

我们实现的模型是 **Decoder-only Transformer**，这意味着：

* **没有 Encoder 部分**，模型没有用于处理输入的部分，只包含了 **自注意力（self-attention）** 和 **前馈网络（feed-forward）**。
* 我们使用 **三角形掩码（triangular mask）**，这样模型只能看到当前和过去的 token，而不能看到未来的 token，这种方式是**自回归**的（autogressive），即它会根据之前生成的内容预测下一个内容。

### ✅ 为什么是 **Decoder-only**？

* 这个模型的任务是 **生成文本**，不需要外部的条件信息。它只是根据给定的数据集 **自发地生成文本**，例如基于莎士比亚的语料生成莎士比亚风格的文本。
* 这种方式下，只需要使用 Decoder 来生成文本，且模型通过 **三角形掩码** 来确保每次生成都仅依赖于当前或过去的内容。

---

## 🏗️ 二、**Encoder-Decoder Transformer**

在原始的 Transformer 论文中，提出了 **Encoder-Decoder 结构**，这是因为它的应用场景是 **机器翻译**，例如从法语翻译成英语。这个结构的特点如下：

1. **Encoder（编码器）**：

   * 读取输入（比如法语句子），并将其转换为一组 token（单词的表示）。
   * 在 Encoder 中，所有的 token 都可以自由交流（没有三角形掩码），这意味着每个 token 可以看到所有其他的 token。
2. **Decoder（解码器）**：

   * 解码器基于输入的 **编码信息** 来生成输出（例如翻译后的英语句子）。
   * 解码器不仅依赖于之前生成的 token（就像我们在 Decoder-only 模型中做的那样），还要**依赖编码器输出的表示**。这部分通过 **Cross-attention（交叉注意力）** 来实现。

     * 在 Cross-attention 中，解码器的 **查询（query）** 依然来自输入（例如当前正在生成的内容），但 **键（key）** 和 **值（value）** 来自 Encoder 的输出，即编码后的法语句子。

### ✅ **Cross-attention** 的作用：

* 通过 Cross-attention，解码器不仅根据当前生成的内容来生成下一个 token，还能够利用编码器生成的完整法语句子的信息，从而生成更符合翻译要求的内容。

---

## 📖 三、为什么我们没有使用 **Encoder** 部分？

* 我们的任务仅仅是 **模仿** 一个给定的数据集（比如莎士比亚的文本），并没有外部条件信息需要考虑（比如翻译的目标语言）。
* 因此，我们不需要 Encoder，只需要 Decoder 来根据上下文生成文本，且这个模型是自回归的（每次生成依赖于之前的内容）。

---

## 🧩 四、总结

> * **Decoder-only Transformer**：用来做语言建模或文本生成，模型只需要处理自回归的生成任务，没有外部输入的条件。
> * **Encoder-Decoder Transformer**：用来做机器翻译等任务，编码器用于读取输入（如法语），解码器用于生成输出（如英语），并通过 Cross-attention 将解码过程与编码结果相结合。

如果你有更多问题或想了解 **Encoder-Decoder 结构** 在其他任务中的应用，随时告诉我！


# super quick walkthrough of nanoGPT, batched multi-headed self-attention

very brief walkthrough of nanog GPT which you can find in my GitHub and uh nanog GPT is basically two files of
Interest there's train.py and model.py train.py is all the boilerplate code for
training the network it is basically all the stuff that we had here it's the training loop it's just that it's a lot
more complicated because we're saving and loading checkpoints and pre-trained weights and we are uh decaying the
learning rate and compiling the model and using distributed training across multiple nodes or GP use so the training
Pi gets a little bit more hairy complicated uh there's more options Etc
but the model.py should look very very um similar to what we've done here in fact the model is is almost identical so
first here we have the causal self attention block and all of this should look very very recognizable to you we're
producing queries Keys values we're doing Dot products we're masking applying soft Maxs optionally dropping
out and here we are pulling the wi the values what is different here is that in
our code I have separated out the multi-headed detention into just a
single individual head and then here I have multiple heads and I explicitly concatenate them whereas here uh all of
it is implemented in a batched manner inside a single causal self attention and so we don't just have a b and a T
and A C Dimension we also end up with a fourth dimension which is the heads and so it just gets a lot more sort of hairy
because we have four dimensional array um tensors now but it is um equivalent
mathematically so the exact same thing is happening as what we have it's just it's a bit more efficient because all
the heads are now treated as a batch Dimension as well then we have the multier perceptron
it's using the Galu nonlinearity which is defined here except instead of Ru and
this is done just because opening I used it and I want to be able to load their checkpoints uh the blocks of the
Transformer are identical to communicate in the compute phase as we saw and then the GPT will be identical we have the
position encodings token encodings the blocks the layer Norm at the end uh the
final linear layer and this should look all very recognizable and there's a bit
more here because I'm loading checkpoints and stuff like that I'm separating out the parameters into those that should be weight decayed and those
that shouldn't um but the generate function should also be very very similar so a
few details are different but you should definitely be able to look at this uh file and be able to understand little
the pieces now so let's now bring things back to chat GPT what would it look like if we wanted to train chat GPT ourselves

这段内容讲解了 **nanoGPT** 的实现，并简要介绍了其中的核心模块和与之前实现的 Transformer 相似之处。下面我将通俗易懂地解释一下：

---

## 🧑‍💻 **nanoGPT 快速概览**

**nanoGPT** 是一个轻量级的 GPT 模型实现，它有两个主要文件：

* **train.py**：负责模型的训练部分，包含训练循环、保存和加载检查点、学习率衰减、分布式训练等。
* **model.py**：定义了 GPT 模型的结构，包括自注意力、前馈网络等。

### ✅ **train.py 文件**

* **train.py** 主要用于训练模型，包含很多训练的细节，如：

  * **保存和加载检查点**：训练过程中会定期保存模型状态，并可以在之后加载预训练的权重。
  * **学习率衰减**：训练过程中根据一定规则调整学习率。
  * **分布式训练**：如果有多个 GPU 或计算节点，可以进行分布式训练。

### ✅ **model.py 文件**

* **model.py** 是实现 GPT 模型的核心文件。它包含了模型的具体结构：

  * **自注意力（Self-attention）**：包括计算查询（Query）、键（Key）和值（Value），并进行矩阵乘法、掩码、Softmax 和 Dropout 等操作。
  * **多头自注意力（Multi-headed Self-attention）**：将多个自注意力头进行批处理，所有的头并行处理，最终将它们的输出进行拼接。这种方法比单独处理每个头更高效。
  * **前馈网络（Feedforward）**：使用 Galu 激活函数（与之前的 ReLU 激活函数不同），这是因为 OpenAI 在 GPT 的实现中使用了 Galu 激活函数。
  * **位置编码和标记编码**：与之前实现的一样，用于为每个输入标记提供位置信息。

### ✅ **与之前实现的区别**

* **多头自注意力**：与之前的实现不同，nanoGPT 中的多头自注意力操作是在一个批次中并行进行的，这使得操作更加高效，因为所有的头都被视为一个批次的维度。这样可以避免繁琐的操作，并提升计算效率。
* **前馈网络**：使用了 Galu 激活函数（在之前的实现中我们用的是 ReLU），这是为了兼容 OpenAI 的 GPT 检查点权重。

### ✅ **生成（Generate）函数**

* `generate` 函数的实现与我们之前的实现非常相似，用于在训练后根据给定的输入生成文本。

---

## 🧩 **总结**

* **nanoGPT** 通过简化 GPT 模型，去除了许多复杂的配置，做了许多优化，使得模型训练变得更加高效。
* 它使用 **多头自注意力**、**位置编码**、**标记编码**、**前馈网络** 等与传统 GPT 模型相同的架构，但在实现上做了性能优化，能更高效地进行并行计算。
* **train.py** 负责训练过程中的细节，如学习率衰减、检查点保存等，**model.py** 则定义了核心的 Transformer 架构。

通过这些优化，nanoGPT 在保持较简洁代码的同时，能够高效地进行训练和生成。


# back to ChatGPT, GPT-3, pretraining vs. finetuning, RLHF

and how does it relate to what we learned today well to train in chat GPT there are roughly two stages first is
the pre-training stage and then the fine-tuning stage in the pre-training stage uh we are training on a large
chunk of internet and just trying to get a first decoder only Transformer to
babble text so it's very very similar to what we've done ourselves except we've
done like a tiny little baby pre-training step um and so in our case
uh this is how you print a number of parameters I printed it and it's about 10 million so this Transformer that I
created here to create little Shakespeare um Transformer was about 10
million parameters our data set is roughly 1 million uh characters so roughly 1 million tokens but you have to
remember that opening I is different vocabulary they're not on the Character level they use these um subword chunks
of words and so they have a vocabulary of 50,000 roughly elements and so their sequences are a bit more condensed so
our data set the Shakespeare data set would be probably around 300,000 uh tokens in the open AI vocabulary roughly
so we trained about 10 million parameter model on roughly 300,000 tokens now when
you go to the gpt3 paper and you look at the Transformers
that they trained they trained a number of trans Transformers of different sizes but the biggest Transformer here has 175
billion parameters uh so ours is again 10 million they used this number of layers in the Transformer this is the
nmed this is the number of heads and this is the head size and then this is
the batch size uh so ours was 65 and the learning rate is similar now
when they train this Transformer they trained on 300 billion tokens so again remember ours is about 300,000
so this is uh about a millionfold increase and this number would not be even that large by today's standards
you'd be going up uh 1 trillion and above so they are training a
significantly larger model on uh a good chunk of the internet
and that is the pre-training stage but otherwise these hyper parameters should be fairly recognizable to you and the
architecture is actually like nearly identical to what we implemented ourselves but of course it's a massive
infrastructure challenge to train this you're talking about typically thousands of gpus having to you know talk to each
other to train models of this size so that's just a pre-training stage now after you complete the pre-training
stage uh you don't get something that responds to your questions with answers and is not helpful and Etc you get a
document completer right so it babbles but it doesn't Babble Shakespeare it babbles
internet it will create arbitrary news articles and documents and it will try to complete documents because that's
what it's trained for it's trying to complete the sequence so when you give it a question it would just uh potentially just give you more questions
it would follow with more questions it will do whatever it looks like the some close document would do in the training
data on the internet and so who knows you're getting kind of like undefined Behavior it might basically answer with
to questions with other questions it might ignore your question it might just try to complete some news article it's
totally unineed as we say so the second fine-tuning stage is to actually align
it to be an assistant and uh this is the second stage and so this chat GPT block
post from openi talks a little bit about how the stage is achieved we basically
um there's roughly three steps to to this stage uh so what they do here is they start to collect training data that
looks specifically like what an assistant would do so these are documents that have to format where the question is on top and then an answer is
below and they have a large number of these but probably not on the order of the internet uh this is probably on the
of maybe thousands of examples and so they they then fine-tune the model to
basically only focus on documents that look like that and so you're starting to slowly align it so it's going to expect
a question at the top and it's going to expect to complete the answer and uh these very very large models are very
sample efficient during their fine-tuning so this actually somehow works but that's just step one that's
just fine tuning so then they actually have more steps where okay the second step is you let the model respond and
then different Raiders look at the different responses and rank them for their preference as to which one is
better than the other they use that to train a reward model so they can predict uh basically using a different network
how much of any candidate response would be desirable and then
once they have a reward model they run po which is a form of polic policy gradient um reinforcement learning
Optimizer to uh fine-tune this sampling policy uh so that the answers that the
GP chat GPT now generates are expected to score a high reward according to the
reward model and so basically there's a whole aligning stage here or fine-tuning stage it's got multiple steps in between
there as well and it takes the model from being a document completer to a
question answerer and that's like a whole separate stage a lot of this data is not available publicly it is internal
to open AI and uh it's much harder to replicate this stage um and so that's
roughly what would give you a chat GPT and nanog GPT focuses on the pre-training stage okay and that's

这段内容介绍了 **ChatGPT** 和 **GPT-3** 的训练过程，重点讲解了 **预训练** 和 **微调** 阶段的不同，以及 **强化学习** 在微调中的应用。下面是通俗易懂的解释：

---

## 🧑‍💻 **ChatGPT 和 GPT-3 的训练流程**

### ✅ **预训练阶段**：

* **预训练** 主要目的是让模型学习语言的基本结构和模式。这个阶段，模型训练的内容来自互联网上的大量文本数据（比如新闻文章、博客、维基百科等）。训练时，模型只关注生成文本，没有专门的任务（例如回答问题）。在这个阶段，模型通过观察大量文本数据，学习如何生成与输入相似的文本。

* 对于我们自己实现的模型来说，**预训练阶段** 就像是训练一个简单的模型，训练数据大约是 **100万字符**，模型参数大约是 **1000万个**。然而，OpenAI 的 GPT-3 模型则训练了 **1750亿个参数**，数据量是 **3000亿个 token**（相当于 1000 多万倍的规模）。这需要巨大的计算资源，比如成千上万的 GPU 来进行训练。

* 预训练阶段的目标是让模型能够“生成文本”，比如给定一个开始的句子，模型能够生成接下来的内容。这是一个 **无监督** 的训练阶段，模型学会了语言模式，但它并不懂得如何回答问题。

### ✅ **微调阶段**：

* 在完成 **预训练** 后，模型并不能直接回答问题。它虽然可以生成文本，但有时会出现无意义的回答，或者无法理解复杂的指令。这时，我们需要对模型进行 **微调**，使其能够更好地完成特定的任务，例如问答、对话等。

* **微调** 通常分为几个步骤：

  1. **数据收集**：收集一些典型的对话数据，这些数据包括 **问题** 和 **答案** 的配对，模拟用户与助手的互动。
  2. **微调训练**：将模型重新训练，专门让它学习这种格式的问题和回答。此时，模型开始适应回答问题的任务，但它还不完美。

* 在微调阶段，**大模型**（例如 GPT-3）会显得更加高效，它能够 **从少量数据中学习**，这就是 **微调** 的优势。

### ✅ **使用强化学习进一步优化**：

* 微调完成后，模型可能依然不是完美的回答者。因此，OpenAI 采用了 **强化学习（RLHF）** 来进一步优化模型的输出。

  * **第一步**：让模型生成一些回答，然后让人工评审人员对这些回答进行排名，选出最好的回答。
  * **第二步**：基于这些评审结果，训练一个 **奖励模型**，让模型知道哪些回答是好的，哪些回答不好。
  * **第三步**：使用 **强化学习** 来优化模型的输出，使得模型生成的回答能够最大化获得的奖励（即最符合评审标准的回答）。

---

## 🧩 **总结**：

* **预训练阶段**：模型在这个阶段学习语言的基本规律，通过大规模的文本数据训练，使其能够生成文本。
* **微调阶段**：通过少量针对性的数据，调整模型让它能够执行特定任务，例如问答。
* **强化学习（RLHF）**：通过人工评审和奖励模型，进一步优化模型的输出，使其生成高质量的答案。

这些步骤的最终目的是让模型从一个简单的文本生成器，发展成为一个能够理解问题并给出合理回答的 **聊天助手**，这也是 **ChatGPT** 的核心。


# conclusions

everything that I wanted to cover today so we trained to summarize a decoder
only Transformer following this famous paper attention is all you need from
2017 and so that's basically a GPT we trained it on Tiny Shakespeare and got
sensible results all of the training code is roughly 200 lines of code I will be
releasing this um code base so also it comes with all the git log commits along
the way as we built it up in addition to this code I'm going to release the um notebook of course the
Google collab and I hope that gave you a sense for how you can train um these
models like say gpt3 that will be um architecturally basically identical to what we have but they are somewhere
between 10,000 and 1 million times bigger depending on how you count and so
uh that's all I have for now uh we did not talk about any of the fine-tuning stages that would typically go on top of
this so if you're interested in something that's not just language modeling but you actually want to you know say perform tasks um or you want
them to be aligned in a specific way or you want um to detect sentiment or anything like that basically anytime you
don't want something that's just a document completer you have to complete further stages of fine tuning which did
not cover uh and that could be simple supervised fine tuning or it can be something more fancy like we see in chat
jpt where we actually train a reward model and then do rounds of Po to uh align it with respect to the reward
model so there's a lot more that can be done on top of it I think for now we're starting to get to about two hours Mark
uh so I'm going to um kind of finish here uh I hope you enjoyed the lecture
uh and uh yeah go forth and transform see you later
